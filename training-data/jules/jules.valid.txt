he suddenly observed , hung over the clock , a card which , upon inspection , proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house . it comprised all that was required of the servant , from eight in the morning , exactly at which hour phileas fogg rose , till half-past eleven , when he left the house for the reform club - all the details of service , the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight , the <unk> at thirty-seven minutes past nine , and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten . everything was regulated and foreseen that was to be done from half-past eleven a . m . till midnight , the hour at which the methodical gentleman retired .

" be so good as to play , mr . stuart , " said phileas fogg .
" it ' s absurd ! " cried stuart , who was beginning to be annoyed at the persistency of his friend . " come , let ' s go on with the game . "
just as the train was whirling through <unk> , passepartout suddenly uttered a cry of despair .

" and you are going - "
these dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns , indicating the month , the day of the month , and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point paris , brindisi , suez , bombay , calcutta , singapore , hong kong , yokohama , san francisco , new york , and london - from the 2nd of october to the 20st of december ; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality . this methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed , and mr . fogg always knew whether he was behind-hand or in advance of his time . on this friday , october 9 th , he noted his arrival at suez , and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost . he sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin , never once thinking of inspecting the town , being one of those englishmen who are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics .
the murmur soon became more distinct ; it now seemed like a distant concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments . passepartout was all eyes and ears . mr . fogg patiently waited without a word . the parsee jumped to the ground , fastened the elephant to a tree , and plunged into the thicket . he soon returned , saying :
a group of old fakirs were <unk> and making a wild ado round the statue ; these were striped with ochre , and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop - stupid fanatics , who , in the great indian ceremonies , still throw themselves under the wheels of <unk> . some brahmins , clad in all the <unk> of oriental apparel , and leading a woman who <unk> at every step , followed . this woman was young , and as fair as a european . her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form .

in which the bag of banknotes <unk> some thousands of pounds more
the first few days of the voyage passed <unk> , amid favourable weather and propitious winds , and they soon came in sight of the great andaman , the principal of the islands in the bay of bengal , with its picturesque saddle peak , two thousand four hundred feet high , looming above the waters . the steamer passed along near the shores , but the savage papuans , who are in the lowest scale of humanity , but are not , as has been asserted , cannibals , did not make their appearance .
" the carnatic . "
" ought she not to have gone yesterday ? "
" what for , mr . fix ? "
fix placed his hand upon passepartout ' s arm , and , lowering his voice , said , " you have guessed who i am ? "
fix pushed passepartout back in his chair , and resumed : " fifty-five thousand pounds ; and if i succeed , i get two thousand pounds . if you ' ll help me , i ' ll let you have five hundred of them . "
in which the master of the " tankadere " runs great risk of losing a reward of two hundred pounds
" well , that ' s enough , " said the honourable william batulcar .
his course decided on , he went on board the general grant , and was there when mr . fogg and aouda arrived . to his utter amazement , he recognised passepartout , despite his theatrical disguise . he quickly concealed himself in his cabin , to avoid an awkward explanation , and hoped - thanks to the number of passengers - to remain unperceived by mr . fogg ' s servant .
" when you please . "
" it was only a meeting assembled for an election . "
the engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle , and he was wise . he would have crushed the first buffaloes , no doubt , with the <unk> ; but the locomotive , however powerful , would soon have been checked , the train would inevitably have been thrown off the track , and would then have been helpless .
passepartout , who had been anxiously watching this amateur <unk> , approached him with lively interest , and learned that he had taken flight after an unpleasant domestic scene .
the track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the great salt lake . from this point it described a long curve , descending towards bitter creek valley , to rise again to the dividing ridge of the waters between the atlantic and the pacific . there were many creeks in this mountainous region , and it was necessary to cross muddy creek , green creek , and others , upon <unk> .
on the declivity of the atlantic basin the first streams , branches of the north platte river , already appeared . the whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense <unk> curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the rocky mountains , the highest being <unk> peak . between this and the railway extended vast plains , plentifully <unk> . on the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the arkansas river , one of the great tributaries of the missouri .
" that ' s impossible . the creek is swelled by the rains . it is a rapid , and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a ford . "
chapter xxx
" and when will another train pass here from san francisco ? "
" gone , " replied fix .
aouda and he had remained , despite the cold , under the portico of the custom house . neither wished to leave the place ; both were anxious to see mr . fogg again .


i reach a sandy square , where camels , with their heads out straight , and their feet bent under in front , are sitting in hundreds . they used to be here in thousands , but since the opening of the transcaspian railway some years ago now , the number of these <unk> beasts of burden has sensibly diminished . just compare one of these beasts with a goods truck or a luggage van !
" quite . "

" forty-two cases ! " i exclaimed .
evidently the american was some distance ahead of me , and yet he was not a reporter by profession .
it is only eight o ' clock . i light my cigar , and with my legs wide apart , to assure my stability as the ship rolled , i begin to walk up and down the deck . the deck is already abandoned by the first-class passengers , and i am almost alone . on the bridge is the mate , pacing backward and forward , and watching the course he has given to the man at the wheel , who is close to him . the paddles are impetuously beating into the sea , and now and then breaking into thunder , as one or the other of the wheels runs wild , as the rolling lifts it clear of the water . a thick smoke rises from the funnel , which occasionally <unk> forth a shower of sparks .
the front van is already full of ephrinell ' s baggage . it does not open at the side , but in front and behind , like the cars . it is also furnished with a platform and a gangway . an interior passage allows the guard to go through it to reach the tender and locomotive if necessary . popof ' s little cabin is on the platform of the first car , in the left-hand corner . at night it will be easy for me to visit the van , for it is only shut in by the doors at the ends of the passage arranged between the packages . if this van is reserved for luggage registered through to china , the luggage for the turkestan stations ought to be in the van at the rear .
he is to windward of him - that is to say , the dishes reach him before they get to the baron , which , however , does not prevent his clearing them without shame .
" the american , " began popof .
" and may heaven bless their union , popof , for they are really made for each other . "
" have they not told you ? "
" yes ; he is on a trip round the world . "
" why not ? " asked popof .
as far back as 1800 the russians had imposed a treaty of alliance on the khan of <unk> . some years afterwards , eager to pursue their march towards the east , the campaigns of 1800 and 1800 had given them the khanats of <unk> and bokhara . two years later , samarkand passed under their dominion after the battles of <unk> and <unk> .
major noltitz had nothing to reproach himself with apparently , for a few minutes after he had said good night he was deep in the sleep of the just .
within , all is quiet under the veiled light of the lamps .
" precisely ; and who knows that if in their wisdom - "
meanwhile i will attend to other business . there is that man in the case . a whole day will elapse before i can relieve his anxiety . in what a state he must be ! but as it would be unwise for me to enter the van during the day , i must wait until night .
and thereupon the pair left us .
" thank you , popof . "
the river is of a <unk> color . a few islands emerge from the current here and there , as far as one can see .

" what a splendid lead ! what an admirable <unk> ! you can see him in <unk> ' s <unk> <unk> or <unk> ' s <unk> . "
" in fact , kinko , " i replied , " there are a few difficult hours for you . "
i need scarcely say that the offer was gladly accepted .
the station is not well lighted . a few lamps give only a feeble light . popof is busy with one of the railway men . the new engine has not yet been attached to the train . the moment seems favorable . it is useless to wait until we have left . if i can reach kinko i shall be able to sleep through the night - and that will be welcome , i admit .
we may as well have a little book learning on the subject ; but it is not i that speak , but major noltitz .
what had happened ?
but what is that i hear being <unk> , or rather <unk> at the end of our compartment ?
" a telegraph messenger ? "
the <unk> couple were right , the enormous loss would have had to be borne by the grand transasiatic , for the company must have known they were carrying a treasure and not a corpse - and thereby they were responsible .
" he would like nothing better , and if there is a wedding breakfast he will sing at your dessert - "
" no , it is not going well , " i reply , " and i am afraid the ammunition will give out . we must settle their commander-in-chief . come , major - "
" to a certain extent , monsieur bombarnac ! " only to a certain extent ? evidently major noltitz is difficult to please .
although it appeared improbable , now that their chief had succumbed , the bandits might still make a nocturnal attack . there were always these cursed millions of the son of heaven to excite their covetousness , and if we are not on our guard -
at daybreak next morning we are at work . the weather is superb . the day will be warm . out in the asian desert on the 4 th of may the temperature is such that you can cook eggs if you only cover them with a little sand .
i need scarcely say that faruskiar , with all the authority of the company ' s general manager , took part in the different formalities that were needed at tcharkalyk . i do not know how to praise him sufficiently . besides , he was repaid for his good offices by the deference shown him by the staff at the railway station .
" for life - like two <unk> , " said the actress , who had not forgotten that these birds are noted for the fidelity of their <unk> .
at seven in the evening we reach kara nor , to stay there fifty minutes . this lake , which is not as extensive as lob nor , absorbs the waters of the <unk> ho , coming down from the nan <unk> mountains . our eyes are charmed with the masses of verdure that clothe its southern bank , alive with the flight of numerous birds . at eight o ' clock , when we left the station , the sun had set behind the sandhills , and a sort of mirage produced by the warming of the lower zones of the atmosphere prolonged the twilight above the horizon .
we are seated at the table . ephrinell has done the thing as well as circumstances permit . in view of the feast , provisions were taken in at tcharkalyk . it is not russian cookery , but chinese , and by a chinese <unk> to which we do honor . luckily we are not condemned to eat it with <unk> , for <unk> are not prohibited at the grand transasiatic table .
" come , major noltitz , come , pan-chao , come , caterna , we have not a minute to spare . "
she " pulled herself together , " and we went up towards a pagoda which rises over the town .
" in a few minutes . "
a network of scaffolding appears confusedly in the darkness , above the piers which were to carry the viaduct across the tjon valley .
" au revoir ! " replied the <unk> lady , rather more dryly at her arrival than at her departure .
and now i have to make a confession , which is very painful to my <unk> . the morning after i arrived in the chinese capital i received a telegram thus worded , in reply to the one i had sent from lan-tcheou :
the night passed in the midst of alarms which would have been death to less energetic souls . again the day appeared and with it the tempest began to moderate . from the beginning of that day , the 4 th of march , it showed symptoms of abating . at dawn , some of the lighter clouds had risen into the more lofty regions of the air . in a few hours the wind had changed from a hurricane to a fresh breeze , that is to say , the rate of the transit of the atmospheric layers was diminished by half . it was still what sailors call " a close-reefed <unk> breeze , " but the commotion in the elements had none the less considerably diminished .
gideon spilett was tall . he was rather more than forty years of age . light whiskers bordering on red surrounded his face . his eye was steady , lively , rapid in its changes . it was the eye of a man accustomed to take in at a glance all the details of a scene . well built , he was inured to all climates , like a bar of steel hardened in cold water .
when neb heard that his master had been made prisoner , he left massachusetts without hesitating an instant , arrived before richmond , and by dint of stratagem and shrewdness , after having risked his life twenty times over , managed to penetrate into the besieged town . the pleasure of harding on seeing his servant , and the joy of neb at finding his master , can scarcely be described .
from time to time the castaways stopped and shouted , then listened for some response from the ocean , for they thought that if the engineer had landed , and they had been near to the place , they would have heard the barking of the dog top , even should harding himself have been unable to give any sign of existence . they stopped to listen , but no sound arose above the roaring of the waves and the dashing of the surf . the little band then continued their march forward , searching into every hollow of the shore .
" right , " replied pencroft ; " the river will be to us like a road which carries of itself , and rafts have not been invented for nothing . "
this same morning , the 6 th of march , at daybreak , neb had set out on the shore in a northerly direction , and he had returned to the spot where the sea , no doubt , had closed over the unfortunate harding .
a whole half-hour passed , but then , as the sailor had <unk> , several couple of grouse returned to their nests . they walked along , pecking the ground , and not suspecting in any way the presence of the hunters , who , besides , had taken care to place themselves to leeward of the gallinaceae .
therefore , as the grouse were cooked , pencroft let the fire die away , and only preserved a few embers buried under the ashes .
" what ? "
it could only be top ! but was he alone or accompanied ? he was most probably alone , for , if neb had been with him , he would have made his way more directly towards the chimneys . the sailor squeezed the reporter ' s hand , for he could not make himself heard , in a way which signified " wait ! " then he <unk> the passage .
the sailor was wrong to despise the proceeding . savages often kindle wood by means of rapid rubbing . but every sort of wood does not answer for the purpose , and besides , there is " the <unk> , " following the usual expression , and it is probable that pencroft had not " the <unk> . "
" chemicals ? "
" i cannot say exactly , " replied the engineer , " but i presume it is some land in the pacific . in fact , when we left richmond , the wind was blowing from the northeast , and its very violence greatly proves that it could not have varied . if the direction has been maintained from the northeast to the southwest , we have traversed the states of north carolina , of south carolina , of georgia , the gulf of mexico , mexico , itself , in its narrow part , then a part of the pacific ocean . i cannot estimate the distance traversed by the balloon at less than six to seven thousand miles , and , even supposing that the wind had varied half a quarter , it must have brought us either to the archipelago of <unk> , either on the <unk> , or even , if it had a greater strength than i suppose , to the land of new zealand . if the last hypothesis is correct , it will be easy enough to get home again . english or maoris , we shall always find some one to whom we can speak . if , on the contrary , this is the coast of a desert island in some tiny archipelago , perhaps we shall be able to reconnoiter it from the summit of that peak which overlooks the country , and then we shall see how best to establish ourselves here as if we are never to go away . "
" herbert ! neb ! look ! " he shouted .
five hundred feet only separated the explorers from the plateau , which they wished to reach so as to establish there an encampment for the night , but these five hundred feet were increased to more than two miles by the zigzags which they had to describe . the soil , as it were , slid under their feet .
cyrus harding reflected a few minutes ; he attentively observed the perimeter of the island , taking into consideration the height at which he was placed ; then , -
" well , now let us set off to the chimneys ! " cried pencroft .
neb reappeared triumphantly holding one of the rodents in each hand . their size exceeded that of a rabbit , their hair was yellow , mingled with green spots , and they had the <unk> <unk> of tails .

pencroft looked attentively at the plant , covered with long silky hair , the leaves being clothed with soft down .
" herbert , " he asked of the lad , " is not this the 5 th of april ? "
at this moment the southern cross presented itself to the observer in an inverted position , the star alpha marking its base , which is nearer to the southern pole .

before anything else could be done it was necessary to make the iron ore , of which the engineer had observed some traces in the northwest part of the island , fit for use by converting it either into iron or into steel .
cyrus harding could have manufactured this substance by treating the carbonate of potash , which would be easily extracted from the cinders of the vegetables , by azotic acid . but this acid was wanting , and he would have been in some difficulty , if nature had not happily furnished the saltpeter , without giving them any other trouble than that of picking it up . herbert found a vein of it at the foot of mount franklin , and they had nothing to do but <unk> this salt .
" here is our dwelling , " said cyrus harding .
however , the wishes of the settlers were for the most part satisfied . chance , aided by the marvelous sagacity of their leader , had done them great service . they had now at their disposal a vast cavern , the size of which could not be properly calculated by the feeble light of their torches , but it would certainly be easy to divide it into rooms , by means of brick partitions , or to use it , if not as a house , at least as a spacious apartment . the water which had left it could not return . the place was free .
the torches were now almost consumed , and as they were obliged to return by the passage to reach the summit of the plateau , it was decided to put off the work necessary for the arrangement of their new dwelling till the next day .
such was the engineer ' s project ; and it was quite feasible , since he had lime and sulphuric acid , while the amphibians of the islet would furnish the fat necessary for the manufacture .
but the engineer had not finished his lecture .
" captain , " asked the sailor , " would it not be a good plan , before setting out , to build a canoe in which we could either ascend the river , or , if we liked , coast round the inland ? it will not do to be <unk> . "
in the meanwhile , considering the rapid current , harding was led to suppose that he and his companions were much farther from the western coast than they had at first supposed . in fact , at this hour , the rising tide would have turned back the current of the creek , if its mouth had only been a few miles distant . now , this effect was not produced , and the water pursued its natural course . the engineer was much astonished at this , and frequently consulted his compass , to assure himself that some turn of the river was not leading them again into the far west .
" that is all ! "
water-birds would prosper there as well as others , and the couple of tinamous taken in their last excursion would be the first to be domesticated .
this was done by means of two stakes securely fixed in the sand . then the settlers , ascending the left bank of the mercy , soon arrived at the angle formed by the river .
" and prepare our second corn-field ! " cried the sailor with a triumphant air .
on the 20st of november , cyrus harding began to plan the canal which was to close the plateau on the west , from the south angle of lake grant to the angle of the mercy . there was there two or three feet of vegetable earth , and below that granite . it was therefore necessary to manufacture some more nitro-glycerine , and the nitro-glycerine did its accustomed work . in less than a fortnight a ditch , twelve feet wide and six deep , was dug out in the hard ground of the plateau . a new trench was made by the same means in the rocky border of the lake , forming a small stream , to which they gave the name of creek glycerine , and which was thus an affluent of the mercy . as the engineer had predicted , the level of the lake was lowered , though very slightly . to complete the enclosure the bed of the stream on the beach was considerably enlarged , and the sand supported by means of stakes .
and , indeed , to work his apparatus there was already a natural force at the disposal of the engineer which could be used without great difficulty . for this , it was enough to augment the flow of the little stream which supplied the interior of granite house with water . the opening among the stones and grass was then increased , thus producing a strong fall at the bottom of the passage , the overflow from which escaped by the inner well . below this fall the engineer fixed a cylinder with paddles , which was joined on the exterior with a strong cable rolled on a wheel , supporting a basket . in this way , by means of a long rope reaching to the ground , which enabled them to regulate the motive power , they could rise in the basket to the door of granite house .
" no , captain , " replied herbert ; " but its stem contains a flour with which nature has provided us all ready ground . "
" it is , then , the bread-tree ? "
and yet so deeply is the love of his country <unk> in the heart of man , that if a ship had unexpectedly come in sight of the island , the colonists would have made signals , would have attracted her attention , and would have departed !
" but an island exists in this part of the pacific already ! "
" about a hundred and fifty miles to the northeast , " replied harding .
the stranding had taken place on the beach of flotsam point , three miles from granite house , and at high tide . it was therefore probable that the cetacean would not be able to extricate itself easily ; at any rate it was best to hasten , so as to cut off its retreat if necessary . they ran with pick-axes and iron-tipped poles in their hands , passed over the mercy bridge , descended the right bank of the river , along the beach , and in less than twenty minutes the settlers were close to the enormous animal , above which flocks of birds already hovered .
in the meanwhile , the monster thus stranded did not move , nor attempt by struggling to regain the water while the tide was still high .
" and it will spare the powder and shot , " rejoined cyrus harding .
" stopped ! and by what ? "
during these storms it was difficult and even dangerous to venture out , owing to the frequently falling trees ; however , the colonists never allowed a week to pass without having paid a visit to the corral . happily , this enclosure , sheltered by the southeastern spur of mount franklin , did not greatly suffer from the violence of the hurricanes , which spared its trees , sheds , and palisades ; but the poultry-yard on prospect heights , being directly exposed to the gusts of wind from the east , suffered considerable damage . the pigeon-house was twice <unk> and the <unk> blown down . all this required to be <unk> more solidly than before , for , as may be clearly seen , lincoln island was situated in one of the most dangerous parts of the pacific . it really appeared as if it formed the central point of vast cyclones , which beat it perpetually as the whip does the top , only here it was the top which was motionless and the whip which moved . during the first week of the month of august the weather became more moderate , and the atmosphere recovered the calm which it appeared to have lost forever . with the calm the cold again became intense , and the thermometer fell to eight degrees fahrenheit , below zero .
" i must go to the corral to-morrow , neb , " replied the lad .
at one moment he advanced so far , that by the light from a revolver he was seen surrounded by five or six large colpeos , with whom he was <unk> with great coolness .
" my word , no , " replied neb . " what astonishes me is that he hasn ' t spoken to us before , for now he wants nothing but speech ! "
" consider , pencroft , " resumed harding , " you cannot go alone to tabor island . "
" it is not quite so deserted as all that , " replied pencroft .
" which we will respect , " interrupted cyrus harding quickly . " if he has committed any crime , he has most fearfully expiated it , and in our eyes he is <unk> . "
" sit down , then . "
" ayrton was alone , but he had no want of either ammunition , weapons , tools , or seeds .
" yes ! " said herbert , " and he was no longer conscious of what he was doing . "
" ayrton has told the truth , " added harding . " do not doubt it , pencroft , for it was painful to him . people tell the truth when they accuse themselves like that ! "
" what is it , captain ? " asked herbert quickly .
" well , my friends , " replied cyrus harding , " during the night of the 9 th of october , neither neb nor i lighted any fire on the coast . "
" we must tell ayrton , " said gideon spilett , " and send for him immediately . he alone can say if it is the ' duncan . ' "
" if it is the ' duncan , ' " said herbert , " ayrton will recognize her without difficulty , since he sailed on board her for some time . "
ayrton took the glass and pointed it in the direction indicated . during some minutes he examined the horizon without moving , without uttering a word . then , -
" well ! who knows ? " said pencroft . " perhaps that cursed craft will stand off during the night , and we shall see nothing of her at daybreak . "
" that is more than your duty . "
this ayrton resolved to learn at any cost , and as an hour after his arrival the vociferations had begun to die away , and as a large number of the convicts were already buried in a drunken sleep , ayrton did not hesitate to venture onto the " speedy ' s " deck , which the extinguished lanterns now left in total darkness . he hoisted himself onto the <unk> , and by the bowsprit arrived at the forecastle . then , gliding among the convicts stretched here and there , he made the round of the ship , and found that the " speedy " carried four guns , which would throw shot of from eight to ten pounds in weight . he found also , on touching them that these guns were breech-loaders . they were therefore , of modern make , easily used , and of terrible effect .
at that moment a hand was laid on ayrton ' s shoulder .
four barrels of the revolver were still <unk> . two were fired - one , aimed at bob harvey , did not wound him , or at any rate only slightly , and ayrton , profiting by the momentary retreat of his adversaries , rushed towards the <unk> to gain the deck . passing before the lantern , he smashed it with a blow from the butt of his revolver . a profound darkness ensued , which favored his flight . two or three pirates , awakened by the noise , were descending the ladder at the same moment .
there was no want of space in the store-rooms of granite house , but that daytime would not allow them to stow away the whole . it would not do also to forget that the six survivors of the " speedy ' s " crew had landed on the island , for they were in all probability scoundrels of the deepest dye , and it was necessary that the colonists should be on their guard against them . although the bridges over the mercy were raised , the convicts would not be stopped by a river or a stream and , rendered desperate , these wretches would be capable of anything .
" come ! " said be . " everybody is against me ! you wish to be generous to those villains ! very well ; i hope we <unk> ' t repent it ! "
moreover , it was necessary for ayrton to return to the corral , where the domesticated animals required his care . it was decided that he should spend two days there , and return to granite house after having liberally supplied the stables .
they waited , of course not without some anxiety .
gideon spilett and cyrus harding reasoned thus with their simple good sense , and they acted as the best surgeon would have done . compresses of linen were applied to poor herbert ' s two wounds , and were kept constantly wet with cold water .
" we shall have to beat the forest , " said the engineer , " and rid the island of these wretches . pencroft ' s presentiments were not mistaken , when he wished to hunt them as wild beasts . that would have spared us all these misfortunes ! "
they had both been there for about ten minutes , when a report was heard , followed by repeated barks .
" that we are not at the end of our trouble yet , my dear spilett , and that his powerful intervention may have another opportunity of exercising itself . but that is not the question now . herbert ' s life before everything . "
" that which struck herbert did not miss , pencroft , " replied the engineer . " besides , observe that if both of you left the corral i should remain here alone to defend it . do you imagine that the convicts will not see you leave it , that they will not allow you to enter the forest , and that they will not attack it during your absence , knowing that there is no one here but a wounded boy and a man ? "
the engineer felt his heart sink painfully . he still hesitated to give the signal for departure ; but that would have driven herbert to despair - killed him perhaps .
and , in speaking thus , cyrus harding thought of herbert , whose recovery the removal had so seriously checked .
during the night of the 8 th of december , herbert was seized by a more violent delirium . his liver was fearfully congested , his brain affected , and already it was impossible for him to recognize any one .
pencroft probably agreed with this decision , for he followed the reporter without making any objection when the latter turned back to the wood .
" and yet we are not mistaken , " remarked the reporter . " mutterings can be distinctly heard in the very bowels of the volcano ! "
three years had passed away since the escape of the prisoners from richmond , and how often during those three years had they spoken of their country , always present in their thoughts !
the colonists , warned by the engineer , left their work and gazed in silence at the summit of mount franklin .
" what does that mean ? " cried neb . " was it the devil who rang it ? "
" we must wait , " said gideon spilett . " if it is a signal , whoever it may be who has made it , he will renew it . "
the colonists proceeded as if they were urged onwards by some irresistible force .
" four days ago . "
" did you doubt it ? " returned harding .
his hand rested upon the cushion of the divan from which he had just risen . he appeared perfectly calm . it was evident that his strength had been gradually undermined by illness , but his voice seemed yet powerful , as he said in english , and in a tone which evinced extreme surprise , -
meanwhile captain nemo withdrew his hand , and motioned the engineer and the reporter to be seated .
" life is simply fading out , " replied the reporter .
cyrus harding then , standing up , cast the light of the lamp upon the walls of the cavern which separated it from the central shaft of the volcano . what was the thickness of this wall ? it might be ten feet or a hundred feet - it was impossible to say . but the subterranean sounds were too perceptible to allow of the supposition that it was of any great thickness .

their labors were now carried on with feverish ardor . by the 20rd of january the vessel was <unk> over . up to this time no change had taken place on the summit of the volcano . vapor and smoke mingled with flames and incandescent stones were thrown up from the crater . but during the night of the 20rd , in consequence of the lava attaining the level of the first stratum of the volcano , the <unk> cone which formed over the latter disappeared . a frightful sound was heard . the colonists at first thought the island was rent asunder , and rushed out of granite house .
no ! no hope of being saved could be retained , and a horrible death , death from hunger and thirst , awaited them upon this rock .

" brave colleagues , - it is some time since an <unk> peace plunged the members of the gun club into deplorable inactivity . after a period of some years , so full of incidents , we have been obliged to abandon our works and stop short on the road of progress . i do not fear to proclaim aloud that any war which would put arms in our hands again would be welcome - "
" ' 1 . is it possible to send a projectile to the moon ?
by watching attentively the spectator would then have seen other molecules in the mass behave like the central planet , and condense in the same manner by a movement of <unk> rotation , and gravitate round it under the form of innumerable stars . the nebulae , of which astronomers count nearly 5000 at present , were formed .

" that is evident , " answered the major ; " but what metal do you intend to employ for your own projectile ? "
" we must use another metal instead of cast-iron . "
" here is the result of my calculations , " answered barbicane . " a projectile of 100 inches in diameter and 10 inches thick would weigh , if it were made of cast-iron , <unk> lbs . ; cast in aluminium it would be reduced to 9200 lbs . "
thus ended the first committee meeting . the question of the projectile was definitely resolved upon , and j . t . maston was delighted with the idea of sending an aluminium bullet to the selenites , " as it will give them no end of an idea of the inhabitants of the earth ! "

" or fulminating cotton , " replied morgan .
" will that be necessary ? " asked the major .
" at 50 , then , " cried the captain , through the newspapers , " at 20 yards from my plate , and i will be behind it . "
<unk> , barbicane was violently attacked about his figures . nicholl tried to prove by a + b the <unk> of his formulae , and he accused him of being ignorant of the rudimentary principles of ballistics . amongst other errors , and according to nicholl ' s own calculations , it was impossible to give any body a velocity of 2000 yards a second . he sustained , algebra in hand , that even with that velocity a projectile thus heavy would never pass the limits of the terrestrial atmosphere . it would not even go eight leagues ! better still . granted the velocity , and taking it as sufficient , the shot would not resist the pressure of the gas developed by the combustion of 1600 , 000 pounds of powder , and even if it did resist that pressure , it at least would not support such a temperature ; it would melt as it issued from the columbiad , and would fall in red-hot rain on the heads of the imprudent spectators .
president barbicane was half driven wild . notes , documents , and letters full of threats inundated his house . which course ought he to decide upon ? in the point of view of <unk> of soil , facility of communications , and rapidity of transport , the rights of the two states were really equal . as to the political <unk> , they had nothing to do with the question .
although in embarrassed circumstances , italy found 2000 , 000 francs in her children ' s pockets , but by turning them well inside out . if she had then possessed <unk> she would have given more , but she did not yet possess <unk> .
florida , discovered by juan ponce de leon in 1500 , on palm sunday , was first of all named <unk> florida . it was well worthy of that designation with its dry and arid coasts . but a few miles from the shore the nature of the ground gradually changed , and the country showed itself worthy of its name ; the soil was cut up by a network of creeks , rivers , watercourses , ponds , and small lakes ; it might have been mistaken for holland or guiana ; but the ground gradually rose and soon showed its cultivated plains , where all the vegetables of the north and south grow in perfection , its immense fields , where a tropical sun and the water <unk> in its clayey texture do all the work of <unk> , and lastly its prairies of <unk> , yams , tobacco , rice , cotton , and <unk> , which extended as far as the eye could reach , spreading out their riches with careless <unk> .
when the first month had gone by the well had attained the depth assigned for the time - i . e . , 100 feet . in december this depth was doubled , and <unk> in january . during february the workmen had to contend against a sheet of water which sprang from the ground . they were obliged to employ powerful pumps and apparatus of compressed air to drain it off , so as to close up the orifice from which it issued , just as leaks are <unk> on board ship . at last they got the better of these unwelcome springs , only in consequence of the loosening of the soil the wheel partially gave way , and there was a <unk> . the frightful force of this <unk> circle , more than 400 feet high , may be imagined ! this accident cost the life of several workmen . three weeks had to be taken up in <unk> the stone <unk> and making the wheel solid again . but , thanks to the skill of the engineer and the power of the machines , it was all set right , and the boring continued .
the president , since the arrival of the message , had not said what he thought about it ; he had let j . t . maston express his opinions without manifesting either approbation or blame . he kept quiet , proposing to await events , but he had not taken public impatience into consideration , and was not very pleased at the sight of the population of tampa town assembled under his windows . murmurs , cries , and vociferations soon forced him to appear . it will be seen that he had all the <unk> as well as the duties of a public man .
barbicane descended into the street , and , heading the immense assemblage , he went towards the telegraph-office .
now how can the emotion be described which took possession of the whole of america ? the effect of the barbicane proposition was surpassed tenfold ; what the newspapers of the union said , the way they accepted the news , and how they chanted the arrival of this hero from the old continent ; how to depict the feverish agitation in which every one lived , counting the hours , minutes , and seconds ; how to give even a feeble idea of the effect of one idea upon so many heads ; how to show every occupation being given up for a single preoccupation , work stopped , commerce suspended , vessels , ready to start , waiting in the ports so as not to miss the arrival of the atlanta , every species of conveyance arriving full and returning empty , the bay of espiritu-santo incessantly ploughed by steamers , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of all dimensions ; how to <unk> in numbers the thousands of curious people who in a fortnight increased the population of tampa town <unk> , and were obliged to encamp under tents like an army in campaign - all this is a task above human force , and could not be undertaken without rashness .
to put the finishing touches to the physical type of the passenger of the atlanta , his garments wide , loose , and flowing , open cravat , wide collar , and cuffs always <unk> , through which came nervous hands . people felt that even in the midst of winter and dangers that man was never cold .
still he was generally liked and treated like a spoiled child . every one was interested in his bold enterprises , and followed them with uneasy mind . he was known to be so imprudent ! when some friend wished to stop him by <unk> an approaching catastrophe , " the forest is only burnt by its own trees , " he answered with an amiable smile , not knowing that he was <unk> the <unk> of arabian <unk> .
" yes , " answered the president of the gun club .
whereupon the president left the cabin , and told the crowd about michel ardan ' s proposition . his words were received with great demonstrations of joy . that cut short all difficulties . the next day every one could contemplate the european hero at their ease . still some of the most obstinate spectators would not leave the deck of the atlanta ; they passed the night on board . amongst others , j . t . maston had screwed his steel hook into the <unk> of the poop , and it would have taken the capstan to get it out again .
" extinct volcanoes , yes ; volcanoes in eruption , no . "
" we will pass on , then , " answered michel ardan , " and leave this series of argument and arrive at direct observation . but i warn you that i am going to quote names . "
" oh , there will always be enough for one man . besides , once delivered up there , i shall do my best to economise it and only to breathe it on great occasions . "

" ah , friend barbicane , i am afraid you will never understand the use , or you would not ask ! "
" without hesitation , " answered the president of the gun club , " and as a <unk> too . "
the secretary of the gun club appeared on the summit of the cone in a triumphant attitude .
the telescope of the rocky mountains .
fire !
the atmospheric current , after throwing over huts and cabins , <unk> trees within a radius of twenty miles , throwing the trains off the railway as far as tampa , burst upon the town like an avalanche and destroyed a hundred houses , amongst others the church of st . mary and the new edifice of the exchange . some of the vessels in the port were run against each other and sunk , and ten of them were stranded high and dry after breaking their chains like threads of cotton .
he resolved not to lose sight of them . his domicile was henceforth the post of long ' s peak - his horizon the immense reflector . as soon as the moon rose above the horizon he immediately framed her in the field of his telescope ; he did not lose sight of her for an instant , and assiduously followed her across the stellar spaces ; he watched with eternal patience the passage of the projectile over her disc of silver , and in reality the worthy man remained in perpetual communication with his three friends , whom he did not despair of seeing again one day .
" we will correspond with them , " said he to any one who would listen , " as soon as circumstances will allow . we shall have news from them , and they will have news from us . besides , i know them - they are ingenious men . those three carry with them into space all the resources of art , science , and industry . with those everything can be accomplished , and you will see that they will get out of the difficulty . "
" but , " said michel , " the cone of shadow thrown by the earth into space extends beyond the moon . "
as to the utensils - pickaxes , spades , and different tools - of which nicholl had made a special collection , the sacks of various kinds of grain , and the shrubs which michel ardan counted upon transplanting into selenite soil , they were in their places in the upper corners of the projectile . there was made a sort of <unk> , which the prodigal frenchman had filled . what was in it was very little known , and the merry fellow did not enlighten anybody . from time to time he climbed up the <unk> riveted in the walls to this store-room , the inspection of which he had reserved to himself . he arranged and <unk> , plunged his hand rapidly into certain mysterious boxes , singing all the time in a voice very out of tune some old french song to enliven the situation .
" it is the inverse of the differential calculus , " answered barbicane seriously .
" now that the expressions are reduced to figures , i am going to find the velocity v zero - that is to say , the velocity that the projectile ought to have on leaving the atmosphere to reach the point of equal attraction with no velocity . the velocity at that point i make equal zero , and x , the distance where the neutral point is , will be represented by the nine-tenths of d - that is to say , the distance that separates the two centres . "
" old fellow , " answered michel , " you have an answer to everything , and i bow before your wisdom . there is one hypothesis i would rather believe than the others , and that is that the selenites being older than we are wiser , and have not invented gunpowder at all . "
" <unk> ! " said michel , " half of v zero square ! do speak the vulgar tongue , man of algebra ! "
" you don ' t know ! " cried michel with a shout that provoked a sonorous echo in the projectile .
" if there are any selenites ! " answered nicholl , who under the empire of this inexplicable intoxication became very contradictory .
" the devil ! " exclaimed michel . " i should only be a <unk> ! "
" that ' s saying a great deal ! "
barbicane still sought the solution of his insoluble problem . the hours went by without result . the projectile visibly drew nearer to the moon , but it was plain that it would not reach her . the short distance at which it would pass her would be the result of two forces , attractive and repulsive , which acted upon the projectile .
the distance which then separated the projectile from the satellite was estimated at about 200 leagues . under these conditions , as far as regards the <unk> of the details of the disc , the travellers were farther from the moon than are the inhabitants of the earth with their powerful telescopes .
" at the northern portion of the sea of clouds , " answered barbicane . " we are too far off to make out its nature . are those plains composed of dry sand , as the first astronomers believed ? or are they only immense forests , according to the opinion of mr . <unk> de la rue , who grants a very low but very dense atmosphere to the moon ? we shall find that out later on . we will affirm nothing till we are quite certain . "
" that mountain is - ? " asked michel .
" do you want to find some vegetation ? " said barbicane .
another consequence of this absence of air is the following : - absolute darkness reigns where the sun ' s rays do not penetrate . what is called diffused light upon the earth , the luminous matter that the air holds in suspension , which creates <unk> and <unk> , which produces shadows , <unk> , and all the magic of the chiaro-oscuro , does not exist upon the moon . hence the harshness of contrasts that only admit two colours , black and white . if a selenite shades his eyes from the solar rays the sky appears absolutely dark , and the stars shine as in the darkest nights .
" the moon has melted , disappeared ! " cried michel ardan , <unk> .
" they would make the voyage for nothing but to go and see the moon , " answered michel .
" allow me , " said michel , interrupting his grave companion .
" the projectile has the choice between two mathematical curves , and it will follow the one or the other according to the velocity with which it is animated , and which i cannot now estimate . "
" but then , " said michel ardan , " air is necessary to feed that combustion , therefore there is some atmosphere on that part of the moon . "
" well , then , my worthy companion , my answer will be that we have seen the lunar continent at a distance of 500 yards , and that nothing appeared to be moving on the surface of the moon . the presence of no matter what form of humanity would be betrayed by <unk> , different constructions , or even ruins . what did we see ? everywhere the geological work of nature , never the work of man . if , therefore , representatives of the animal kingdom exist upon the moon , they have taken refuge in those bottomless cavities which the eye cannot reach . and i cannot admit that either , for they would have left traces of their passage upon the plains which the atmosphere , however slight , covers . now these traces are nowhere visible . therefore the only hypothesis that remains is one of living beings without movement or life . "
" why so ? " asked nicholl quickly .
the conical summit of the bullet had already sensibly turned towards the lunar disc . the projectile was just right for <unk> all the recoil produced by setting fire to the apparatus . chance was therefore in the travellers ' favour . if the velocity of the projectile were to be absolutely annihilated upon the neutral point , a given motion , however slight , towards the moon would determine its fall .
and they did make haste . they prepared the susquehanna for her new destination . her powerful engines were arranged to be used for the hauling machines . the aluminium projectile only weighed 9200 lbs . , a much less weight than that of the transatlantic cable , which was picked up under similar circumstances . the only difficulty lay in the smooth sides of the cylindro-conical bullet , which made it difficult to <unk> .
" without losing a second , " answered j . t . maston .
" what the matter is ? "

" but allow me to point out that my <unk> unquestionably gives me a prior right . "
" in that case , however , " continued the count , " it will be necessary to assign an ostensible pretext of some kind . shall we <unk> a musical dispute ? a contention in which i feel bound to defend <unk> , while you are the zealous <unk> of <unk> ? "
beyond the ditch lay a small piece of meadow land , about an acre in extent . a soft and delicious herbage carpeted the soil , whilst trees formed a charming framework to the whole . no spot could have been chosen more suitable for the meeting between the two adversaries .
meantime , with the agility of a monkey , ben zoof had clambered to the top of a eucalyptus , and from his lofty perch was surveying the country to the south , as well as towards both tenes and mostaganem . on descending , be informed the captain that the plain was deserted .
the captain <unk> no reply , but , muttering some expressions of regret for the fruitless trouble he had taken about his rondo , betook himself to rest .
" take my advice , ben zoof , " he said ; " leave your eggs in the <unk> a good quarter of an hour . "
but captain servadac could not altogether enter into his servant ' s enthusiasm . if this were actually the moon , her distance from the earth must have been increased by some millions of miles . he was rather disposed to suspect that it was not the earth ' s satellite at all , but some planet with its apparent magnitude greatly enlarged by its approximation to the earth . taking up the powerful field-glass which he was accustomed to use in his surveying operations , he proceeded to investigate more carefully the luminous orb . but he failed to trace any of the <unk> , supposed to resemble a human face , that mark the lunar surface ; he failed to decipher any indications of hill and plain ; nor could he make out the <unk> of light which <unk> from what astronomers have designated mount tycho . " it is not the moon , " he said slowly .
the continuance of the splendid weather afforded servadac every facility for observing the heavens . night after night , constellations in their beauty lay stretched before his eyes - an alphabet which , to his mortification , not to say his rage , he was unable to decipher . in the apparent dimensions of the fixed stars , in their distance , in their relative position with regard to each other , he could observe no change . although it is established that our sun is approaching the constellation of hercules at the rate of more than 6000 , 000 miles a year , and although <unk> is traveling through space at the rate of fifty-four miles a second - three times faster than the earth goes round the sun , - yet such is the remoteness of those stars that no appreciable change is evident to the senses . the fixed stars taught him nothing .
there was nothing more to explore . the three together quitted the mosque , and descended the rock to the shore , whence their boat <unk> them to the schooner , which was soon again on her southward voyage ; and it was not long before the tomb of st . louis , the only spot that had survived the mysterious shock , was lost to view .
" strange , indeed , " replied lieutenant procope ; " and what appears to me almost as remarkable is that we have never once caught sight either of one of the <unk> <unk> or one of the <unk> <unk> that traffic so regularly on the mediterranean . "
the lieutenant , who had shouted from the bow , rushed astern and took the helm , and before anyone had time to <unk> upon the object of his maneuvers , he shouted again , " look out ! sharp ! watch the sheets ! "
and true it was that the flag that floated at the head of yonder mast was the blue cross of russia .
" allow me to introduce you to count wassili timascheff . "
" ben who ? " inquired the major .
colonel murphy turned deliberately away from servadac , and appealed to the count : " do you not think you may have made some error , count , in reckoning the bearings of your yacht ? "
" but do not the italian <unk> assist you ? " continued the count .
although count timascheff secretly <unk> with servadac , he had carefully refrained from taking part in the dispute ; but he was on the point of interfering , when the colonel , in a greatly subdued tone , begged to be allowed to speak .
gibraltar ! the word fell like a <unk> upon their ears . gibraltar ! the western extremity of the mediterranean ! why , had they not been sailing persistently to the east ? could they be wrong in imagining that they had reached the <unk> islands ? what new mystery was this ?
listening attentively , servadac and his associates could distinctly recognize a human voice , accompanied by the notes of a guitar and by the measured <unk> of castanets .
the captain glanced inquiringly towards ben zoof , and the orderly , by a significant nod , made his master understand that he was to play the part that was implied by the title . he took the <unk> , and promptly ordered the jew to hold his tongue at once . the man bowed his head in <unk> submission , and folded his hands upon his breast .
the hansa had weighed anchor on the 3rd of february . the wind blew from the west , and consequently the working of the tartan was easy enough . the <unk> sailors had only to hoist their sails and , though they were quite unconscious of the fact , the breeze carried them to the only spot upon the little world they occupied which could afford them a refuge .
" to spain ! " echoed isaac hakkabut , with a hideous yell . " do they expect to go back to spain till they have paid their <unk> ? your excellency , they owe me twenty reals apiece for their passage here ; they owe me two hundred reals . are they to be allowed . . . ? "
" if so , it must be in flames ; otherwise we should not be able to see it so far off , " replied procope .
the need for haste in <unk> their preparations became more and more manifest ; the sea threatened to be <unk> very soon , as ice was already forming which the <unk> sun was unable to melt . and if haste were necessary , so also were care , ingenuity , and forethought . it was indispensable that the space at their command should be properly utilized , and yet that the several portions of the store should all be readily accessible .
" you are going the right way to ruin yourself , and it would serve you right to leave you to your own devices . but be off ! i have no more to say . "
" as to rest , " said servadac , " we shall take none ; we shall keep on our way continuously ; by traveling day and night without intermission , we shall not be more than three days in reaching formentera . "

" is it possible ? " he exclaimed . " here is my old <unk> , mr . rosette , in very flesh and blood . "
" i . " replied the <unk> voice .
fortunately for the sake of peace , isaac hakkabut , who at length was beginning to realize something of the true condition of things , came forward at this moment , and in a voice trembling with eagerness , implored the professor to tell him when they would all be back again upon the earth .
" no hurry at all , " observed the captain , who was not in the least impatient to continue his mathematical exercises .
" it makes me very uneasy , " rejoined the lieutenant ; " in shallow places like this , as the crust of ice <unk> , it forces everything upwards with irresistible force . "
servadac , however , declined to enter until he had taken the pains to explain to the owner of the tartan that he had no intention of laying violent hands upon his property , and that if the time should ever come that his cargo was in requisition for the common use , he should receive a proper price for his goods , the same as he would in europe .
" we have only come to know whether you can lend us a steelyard . "
" let me see , " said servadac , " how much is that in all ? two hundred and thirty francs , is it not ? "
with a good-natured laugh at the orderly ' s remark , the meeting <unk> for a few hours . by the appointed time the engineer had finished his task , and with all due care had prepared a cubic decimeter of the material of the comet .
" there , gentlemen , one hundred and thirty-three grammes ! less than one-seventh of a kilogramme ! you see , consequently , that the force of gravity here on gallia is not one-seventh of what it is upon the earth ! "
" i thought not ; it is of no use waiting for your <unk> to make it out . i must talk to those who can understand . "
the captain could not help himself : he was forced to confess that his memory had failed him .
" though it could not anyhow have been very much smaller , " he added , looking <unk> at the professor .
hakkabut pointed out that the weight was duly registered on every packet , and that the packets had never been unfastened . the captain , however , had his own special object in view , and would not be diverted . the jew fetched his steelyard , and a packet of the tobacco was suspended to it .
in about half an hour , proceeding in a southerly direction , they had descended nearly five hundred feet . from time to time they came upon large excavations that at first sight had all the appearance of galleries , but by waving his torch , ben zoof could always see their extreme limits , and it was evident that the lower strata of the mountain did not present the same system of <unk> that rendered the hive above so commodious a residence .
" quite near enough for me ! " exclaimed ben zoof . " those who are chilly are welcome to go as much lower as they like . for my part , i shall be quite warm enough here . "
it did , indeed , more than once occur to the minds both of servadac and his friends that , if their condition should become one of extreme emergency , they might , as a last resource , betake themselves to gibraltar , and there seek a refuge ; but their former reception had not been of the <unk> , and they were little disposed to renew an <unk> that was marked by so little cordiality . not in the least that they would expect to meet with any inhospitable rebuff . far from that ; they knew well enough that englishmen , whatever their faults , would be the last to abandon their fellow-creatures in the hour of distress . nevertheless , except the necessity became far more urgent than it had hitherto proved , they resolved to endeavor to remain in their present quarters . up till this time no <unk> had diminished their original number , but to undertake so long a journey across that <unk> expanse of ice could scarcely fail to result in the loss of some of their party .
but , however great was his desire to ascertain what this discovery implied , his curiosity was not yet destined to be gratified . the professor kept muttering in incoherent phrases : " rascal ! he shall pay for it yet . i will be even with him ! <unk> ! thrown me out ! " but he did not <unk> any reply to servadac ' s inquiries , and withdrew to his study .
from that day rosette , for some reason at present incomprehensible , quite altered his behavior to isaac hakkabut , a man for whom he had always hitherto evinced the greatest repugnance and contempt . all at once he began to show a remarkable interest in the jew and his affairs , paying several visits to the dark little storehouse , making inquiries as to the state of business and expressing some solicitude about the state of the <unk> .
the <unk> jew was taken somewhat by surprise , but came to an immediate conclusion that the professor was contemplating <unk> some money ; he was consequently very cautious in all his replies .
" yes , it is only too clear ; they have already occupied it , and established their communications , " said servadac .
" professor rosette , i suppose , " ben zoof remarked , " would pretty soon find out all about that . "
truly daring was the plan of which lieutenant procope had thus become the originator ; but the very existence of them all was at stake , and the design must be executed resolutely . for the success of the enterprise it was absolutely necessary to know , almost to a minute , the precise time at which the collision would occur , and captain servadac undertook the task , by gentle means or by stern , of extracting the secret from the professor .
the surprise only kindled their emotion to yet keener intensity , and it would be hard to describe the excitement with which they gazed at the panorama that was before them . the crisis of peril was close at hand , but imagination <unk> all consideration of danger ; and everything was absorbed in the one idea that they were again within reach of that circle of humanity from which they had supposed themselves severed forever .

james starr stood upright , at the door of the vast shed in which he had for so many years superintended the powerful machines of the shaft . simon ford , the foreman of the dochart pit , then fifty-five years of age , and other managers and <unk> , surrounded him . james starr took off his hat . the miners , cap in hand , kept a profound silence . this farewell scene was of a touching character , not wanting in grandeur .
as the waters were contained in no bed , and were spread over every part of the globe , they rushed where they liked , tearing from the <unk> rocks material with which to compose <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . this the roving waves bore over the submerged and now <unk> forests , and deposited above them the elements of rocks which were to <unk> the coal strata . in course of time , periods of which include millions of years , these <unk> hardened in layers , and enclosed under a thick carapace of <unk> , schist , compact or <unk> sandstone , gravel and stones , the whole of the massive forests .
james starr examined , as well as the insufficient light would permit , the sides of the dark shaft , which were covered by a partly rotten lining of wood .
" well , we must let this intruder pass , " said james starr . " those who are descending must yield the path to those who are ascending . "
" yes , mr . starr , it will be prudent . "
harry , who preceded his father and the engineer , stopped .
" someone has stopped up the cracks in the schist ! "

we may add that the working of this mine would be singularly facilitated by the fantastic dispositions of the secondary <unk> ; for by an unaccountable retreat of the mineral matter at the geological epoch , when the mass was <unk> , nature had already multiplied the galleries and tunnels of new aberfoyle .
" let us rest awhile , then , my friends , " returned the engineer . " besides , we ought to be thinking of returning to the cottage . "
james starr and his companions walked on in the order agreed . they did not speak , but it was not for want of thinking . it became evident that they had an adversary . but what was he , and how were they to defend themselves against these <unk> attacks ? these disquieting ideas crowded into their brains . however , this was not the moment to get discouraged .
" courage , comrades ! " he exclaimed ; " it is getting tired ! we shall soon catch it up now , and if it can talk as well as it can run we shall hear a fine story . "
the cord was fastened round harry ' s thighs and under his arms , to keep him from rocking . thus supported , he was free to use both his hands . a <unk> hung at his belt , also a large , strong knife in a leather <unk> .
an extremely narrow passage led aside out of the pit . he had to <unk> to look into it , and only by creeping could it be followed ; but as he wanted to see in which direction it led , and whether another abyss opened from it , he lay down on the ground and began to enter it on hands and knees .
" because those men were james starr , my father , and myself , nell ! "
" jack , you don ' t know what you are talking about ! "
james starr went as an observer and philosopher , curious to note , from a <unk> point of view , the novel impressions made upon nell ; perhaps also with some hope of <unk> a clue to the mysterious events connected with her childhood . harry , with a little <unk> , asked himself whether it was not possible that this rapid <unk> into the things of the exterior world would change the maiden he had known and loved hitherto into quite a different girl . as for jack ryan , he was as joyous as a <unk> rising in the first beams of the sun . he only trusted that his gayety would prove contagious , and enliven his traveling companions , thus <unk> them for letting him join them . nell was pensive and silent .
now the distant horizon of the sea became more plainly visible . the scale of colors fell into the order of the solar . every instant they increased in intensity , rose color became red , red became fiery , daylight dawned . nell now glanced towards the city , of which the outlines became more distinct . lofty monuments , slender steeples emerged from the gloom ; a kind of ashy light was spread abroad . at length one solitary ray struck on the maiden ' s sight . it was that ray of green which , morning or evening , is reflected upwards from the sea when the horizon is clear .
" ah ! now i understand that the very thought of him must have terrified poor little nell , and also i see that she could not bear to denounce her grandfather . what a miserable time she must have had of it with the old man ! "
" at least fifty times during the last three centuries , but without success . "
" very true , the poor little one , " answered the good dame , drying her eyes , which this recital had filled with tears . " and he is our child now , for we have adopted him . i do not know why mr . malarius should say anything to the contrary . "
" yes , but the cradle was attached to a buoy , you said , and it is customary on all vessels to write on the buoy the name of the ship to which it belongs , " answered the doctor , fixing his penetrating eyes upon those of the fisherman .
" that is true ; but what do we know about it , after all . perhaps she also has had a miraculous escape . "
if mr . hersebom had been struck on the head with a club , he would not have been more astonished than he was by this proposal .
" i do not doubt it , " answered the fisherman , with a sad smile .
" books - who cares for them ? there are velvet <unk> , and sofas , lace curtains , a splendid french clock , and carpets from turkey ! "
" the name ' cynthia , ' i find in very common use in the english navy . from <unk> ' s office , they inform me , that there are seventeen ships , of different tonnage , bearing this name . some of these ships belong to english ports , and some to scotland and ireland . my supposition concerning the nationality of the child is therefore confirmed , and it becomes more and more evident to me that erik is of irish <unk> . i do not know whether you agree with me on this point , but i have already mentioned it to two of my most intimate friends in stockholm , and everything seems to confirm it .
the eyes of the young man as he looked around him fell on all their loving countenances - the maternal look of the loving wife , the honest face of mr . hersebom , that of otto even more affectionate than usual , and that of vanda , serious and troubled . as he read the tenderness and disquietude displayed on all their faces , erik felt as if his heart was melting within him . in a moment he realized his situation , and saw vividly the scene which his father had described . the cradle abandoned to the mercy of the waves , rescued by the hardy fisherman , and carried to his wife ; and these people , humble and poor as they were , had not hesitated to take care of the little stranger , to adopt and <unk> him as their own son . they had not spoken of the matter for fourteen years , and now they were hanging on his words as if they were a matter of life and death to them .
but on the distant and less frequented coasts , in the <unk> , the number of shipwrecks was beyond computation .
this persistence deserved some recompense . toward two o ' clock as they approached a large island , kaas began suddenly to bark furiously ; then before they could prevent him he threw himself into the water , and swam to the shore .
mr . <unk> had taken one of mr . hersebom ' s hand ' s , and was feeling his pulse and he shook his head , sadly and doubtfully ; but he would not neglect any of the means which are usually tried in such cases . after taking off a large woolen girdle which he wore around his waist , he tore it in three pieces , and giving one to each of the young men , they rubbed vigorously the body , the arms , and the legs of the fisherman .
one fine evening , just as the <unk> was approaching , it occurred to them that it would be a good idea to make an excursion to new york together , and see if they could , obtain any further news about the matter .
it was important to find this detective , as well as patrick o ' donoghan .
dr . schwaryencrona and his friends , after taking leave of mr . and mrs . bowles , resolved to pursue this route . the steamers between new york and liverpool touch at cork , and this was only a few miles from <unk> , the place where patrick was born . there they learned that patrick o ' donoghan had never returned to his native place since he left it at the age of twelve years , and that they had never heard from him .
" take a seat , sir , " answered the doctor .
the doctor was too much taken <unk> by this <unk> announcement to say a word , and only looked at his visitor , who continued :
" yes , several . "
" had you known him for a long time ? " asked the doctor .
" because , if the ' vega ' has not perished she is inclosed in the ice , and she will not be able , at the best , to extricate herself before june or july . "
" a pleasant traveling companion truly , " mr . marsilas could not help saying .
" what is the matter ? " cried the captain , still <unk> by his fall .
the " alaska " had been thrown upon the rocks with such violence that she remained perfectly motionless , and the situation did not appear to be immediately dangerous for her crew and passengers . the waves , encountering this unusual obstacle , beat over the deck , and covered everything with their spray ; but the sea was not rough enough to make this state of affairs dangerous . if the weather did not change , day would break without any further disaster . erik saw this at a glance . he had naturally taken command of the vessel , as he was the first officer . having given orders to close the <unk> and scuttles carefully , and to throw tarred cloths over all openings , in case the sea should become rougher , he descended to the bottom of the hold , in company with the master carpenter . there he saw with great satisfaction that no water had entered . the exterior covering of the " alaska " had protected her , and the precaution which they had taken against polar icebergs had proved very efficacious against the rocky coast ; in fact the engine had stopped at once , being <unk> by the frightful shock , but it had produced no explosion , and they had , therefore , no vital damage to <unk> . erik resolved to wait for daybreak , and then disembark his passengers if it should prove necessary .
as day commenced to dawn he had the satisfaction of perceiving that the waves visibly receded , and if they continued to do so the " alaska " would be left almost on dry rocks . this gave him hope of being able speedily to determine the extent of the damage which the vessel had received , and , in fact , toward seven o ' clock they were able to proceed with this examination .
the first one which they opened was that of <unk> , and at a glance the french officer pointed out two or three grave errors . the second was that of cape vincent . it was the same .
the second read :
mr . hersebom also , although but little inclined in general , and especially in his present situation , to admire the splendor of nature in the arctic regions , could not help being impressed with them .
" yes , a vessel that set out in 1800 for the arctic seas . part of her crew were left , as we are , on a floating field of ice , while they were occupied in transporting some provisions and coal . the brave men <unk> themselves as well as they could to this new life , and after floating for six mouths and a half over a distance of several thousand leagues , ended by landing in the arctic regions of north america . "
it took erik and mr . hersebom more than an hour to walk to the extreme end of their island . they had followed closely the eastern side , because that permitted them to explore at the same time both their raft and the sea . suddenly kaas , who ran ahead of them , put to flight some of the walruses which they had seen in the distance . they ran toward the border of the field of ice in order to throw themselves into the water . nothing would have been more easy than to have killed a number of them . but what would have been the use of their doing so , since they could not make a fire to roast their delicate flesh ? erik was occupied about other matters . he carefully examined the ice-field , and found that it was far from being homogeneous . numerous crevasses and fissures , which seemed to extend in many cases for a long distance , made him fear that a slight shock might divide it into several fragments . it was true that these fragments might in all probability be of considerable size ; but the possibility of such an accident made them realize the necessity of keeping as close as possible to their depot of provisions , unless they wished to be deprived of them . erik resolved to examine carefully their whole domain , and to make his abode on the most massive portion ; the one that seemed capable of offering the greatest resistance . he also determined to transport to this spot their depot of provisions .
the exclamation of the irishman confirmed the suspicion which during the last hour had presented itself to his mind .
mr . jones and tudor brown were one and the same person .
tudor brown raised his gun and shot patrick o ' donoghan through the heart , who fell backward .

for several days she had been disturbed by his strange behavior , by the dispatches which were continually arriving , and by the double meaning which she thought she detected beneath all he said . accustomed to talk with him about his lightest thoughts and impressions , she could not understand why he should seek to conceal anything from her . several times she had been on the point of demanding a solution of the enigma , but she had kept silence , out of respect for the evident wishes of her father .
the doctor was <unk> for a moment by this speech , but he soon recovered himself .
the leading members of the club , namely president barbican , secretary marston , major elphinstone and general morgan , forming the <unk> committee , held several meetings to discuss the shape and material of the bullet , the nature and position of the cannon , and the quantity and quality of the powder . the decision soon arrived at was as follows : 1st - the bullet was to be a hollow aluminium shell , its diameter nine feet , its walls a foot in thickness , and its weight 9200 pounds ; 2nd - the cannon was to be a columbiad 900 feet in length , a well of that depth forming the vertical mould in which it was to be cast , and 3rd - the powder was to be 400 thousand pounds of gun cotton , which , by developing more than 200 thousand millions of cubic feet of gas under the projectile , would easily send it as far as our satellite .
a frenchman from paris , michel ardan by name , eccentric , but keen and shrewd as well as daring , demanded , by the atlantic telegraph , permission to be enclosed in the bullet so that he might be carried to the moon , where he was curious to make certain investigations . received in america with great enthusiasm , ardan held a great meeting , triumphantly carried his point , reconciled barbican to his mortal foe , a certain captain m ' nicholl , and even , by way of <unk> the reconciliation , induced both the newly made friends to join him in his contemplated trip to the moon .
all the articles that it contained , arms , instruments , utensils , etc . , were solidly fastened to the projections of the wadding , so as to sustain the least injury possible from the first terrible shock . in fact , all precautions possible , humanly speaking , had been taken to counteract this , the first , and possibly one of the very greatest dangers to which the courageous adventurers would be exposed .
" four minutes and a half more , " said barbican .
were they three corpses ? had the projectile suddenly become a great metallic coffin bearing its ghastly contents through the air with the rapidity of a lightning flash ?
so saying , he contrived without much difficulty to get on his feet . balancing himself then for a moment , he began groping about for the gas . but he stopped suddenly .
they worked at him , in fact , so vigorously , intelligently and <unk> , that , after what they considered a long hour ' s labor , they had the delight of seeing the pale face assume a healthy hue , the inert limbs give signs of returning animation , and the breathing become strong and regular .
" then , mac , my boy , you ' ve lost your two bets ! " interrupted ardan . " the columbiad has not burst , four thousand dollars ; the projectile has risen at least six miles , five thousand dollars ; come , captain , bleed ! "
" let us see , barbican , " asked m ' nicholl ; " where has petit ' s calculation placed us ? "
" nearly four times as far , " said barbican ; " still , as the moon ' s orbit and the earth ' s do not lie in exactly the same plane , a lunar eclipse can occur only when the <unk> coincide with the period of the full moon , which is generally twice , never more than three times in a year . if we had started about four days before the occurrence of a lunar eclipse , we should travel all the time in the dark . this would have been <unk> for many reasons . "
" one feels good here , " cried the captain , rubbing his hands .
the inspection having thus given general satisfaction , the travellers once more set themselves to watching external space through the lights in the sides and the floor of the projectile .
" that i comprehend . "
they could say no more . this fearful revelation took them like a stroke of <unk> .
the colds of space .
the three friends kept profound silence for some time . breakfast now was the last thing thought of . barbican , with teeth grating , fingers clutching , and <unk> closely contracting , gazed grimly through the window . the captain , as a last resource , once more examined his calculations , earnestly hoping to find a figure wrong . ardan could neither sit , stand nor lie still for a second , though he tried all three . his silence , of course , did not last long .
" and poets like homer , virgil , dante , <unk> , <unk> and hugo ? "
chapter vi .
" you would not have much time to record your observations , friend michael , i assure you , " observed barbican . " the case is plain enough . heat and motion are <unk> terms . what do we mean by heating water ? simply giving increased , in fact , violent motion to its molecules . "
" not a doubt of it ! " said the captain . " president , " he added after a moment , " haven ' t they calculated what would be the result , if the earth were suddenly brought to a stand-still in her journey , through her orbit ? "
" such a fall , " answered barbican , " according to the calculations of <unk> and <unk> , would develop an amount of heat equal to that produced by sixteen hundred globes of burning coal , each globe equal in size to the earth itself . furthermore such a fall would supply the sun with at least as much heat as he <unk> in a hundred years ! "
" o yes ; solar eclipses " replied barbican , " must always occur whenever the centres of the three heavenly bodies are in the same line , the earth occupying the middle place . however , such eclipses must always be annular , as the earth , projected like a screen on the solar disc , allows more than half of the sun to be still visible . "
" what on earth can such a <unk> be , barbican ? " asked ardan , who every now and then liked to <unk> his stock of american <unk> . " is it one of those particles of meteoric matter you were speaking of just now , caught within the sphere of our projectile ' s attraction and accompanying us to the moon ? "
" and mine ? " asked ardan .
chapter x .
the spherical surface , however , had long since begun to reveal its convexity . the moon was gradually assuming the appearance of a gigantic egg with the smaller end turned towards the earth . in the earlier days of her formation , while still in a state of mobility , she had been probably a perfect sphere in shape , but , under the influence of terrestrial gravity operating for <unk> ages , she was drawn at last so much towards the centre of attraction as to resemble somewhat a <unk> <unk> . by becoming a satellite , she had lost the native perfect regularity of her outline ; her centre of gravity had shifted from her real centre ; and as a result of this arrangement , some scientists have drawn the conclusion that the moon ' s air and water have been attracted to that portion of her surface which is always invisible to the inhabitants of the earth .
whilst occupied in this silent work , they could not help throwing a short <unk> glance on the former observers of the moon .
as already observed , the surrounding plains were dotted with numberless craters mostly of small dimensions , except gay <unk> on the north , whose crater was about 10 miles in diameter . towards the southwest and the immediate east , the plain appeared to be very flat , no protuberance , no prominence of any kind lifting itself above the general dead level . towards the north , on the contrary , as far as where the peninsula jutted on oceanus procellarum , the plain looked like a sea of lava wildly lashed for a while by a furious hurricane and then , when its waves and breakers and driving ridges were at their wildest , suddenly frozen into solidity . over this rugged , <unk> , wrinkled surface and in all directions , ran the wonderful streaks whose radiating point appeared to be the summit of copernicus . many of them appeared to be ten miles wide and hundreds of miles in length .
{ altai mountains 10° to 20 <unk> . southern { cordilleras 10 to 20 2000 hemisphere . { pyrenees 8 to 10 2000 { <unk> 5 to 10 2600
" how ' s that , barbican ? " asked ardan doubtfully , but unwilling to submit to m ' nicholl .
" what do you mean ? " asked barbican .
" in the question under consideration , however , " continued the frenchman , " my conjecture has this advantage over some others : it explains why these <unk> appear and seem to disappear at regular intervals . "
" passed unanimously ! " cried m ' nicholl .
" no , i don ' t ! " cried ardan , not at all <unk> by his friend ' s <unk> tone , and sticking like a man to his first assertion right or wrong . " i know what i say ! it will be all the sun ' s fault if we use up our gas ! "
" these phenomena , " continued barbican , heedless of interruption and his voice betraying a slight glow of excitement , " these phenomena going on without interruption from month to month , from year to year , from age to age , from <unk> to <unk> , have finally convinced me that - what ? " he asked his hearers , interrupting himself suddenly .
- " that to live on the dark side would be much more inconvenient than on the light side ! " cried m ' nicholl promptly .
" yes , i have no doubt of that , friend michael , " pursued barbican ; " but to see the eclipse it would not be necessary to quit the dark hemisphere altogether . you are , of course , aware that in consequence of her <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , the moon presents to the eyes of the earth a little more than the exact half of her disc . she has two motions , one on her path around the earth , and the other a shifting around on her own axis by which she endeavors to keep the same side always turned towards our sphere . this she cannot always do , as while one motion , the latter , is strictly uniform , the other being eccentric , sometimes <unk> her and sometimes retarding , she has not time to shift herself around completely and with perfect correspondence of movement . at her perigee , for instance , she moves forward quicker than she can shift , so that we detect a portion of her western border before she has time to conceal it . <unk> , at her apogee , when her rate of motion is comparatively slow , she <unk> a little too quickly for her velocity , and therefore cannot help revealing a certain portion of her eastern border . she shows altogether about 8 degrees of the dark side , about 4 at the east and 4 at the west , so that , out of her 300 degrees , about 100 , in other words , a little more than 50 per cent . , about 4 / 7 of the entire surface , becomes visible to human eyes . consequently a selenite could catch an occasional glimpse of our earth , without altogether quitting the dark side . "
" you don ' t say so ! " cried ardan , with mouth <unk> . " do tell ! "
" the next in rank , " replied barbican promptly , " are those about the size of the <unk> , that is to say about <unk> / 4 miles in height . they are <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . come , " he added , seeing ardan hesitating and at a loss what other question to ask , " don ' t you want to know what lunar mountains are about the same height as the peak of teneriffe ? or as <unk> ? or as mount washington ? you need not be afraid of puzzling me . i studied up the subject thoroughly , and therefore know all about it . "
" oh ! i could listen to you with delight all day long ! " cried ardan , enthusiastically , though with some embarrassment , for he felt a <unk> of conscience in acting so <unk> towards his beloved friend . " the fact is , " he went on , " such a rational conversation as the present , on such an absorbing subject , with such a perfect master - "
barbican was the first to dissolve the reverie by jumping up . his sharp eye had noticed that the base of the projectile , instead of keeping rigidly perpendicular to the lunar surface , turned away a little , so as to render the elliptical orbit somewhat elongated . this he made his companions immediately observe , and also called their attention to the fact that from this point they could easily have seen the earth had it been full , but that now , drowned in the sun ' s beams , it was quite invisible . a more attractive spectacle , however , soon engaged their <unk> attention - that of the moon ' s southern regions , now brought within about the third of a mile by their telescopes . immediately resuming their posts by the windows , they carefully noted every feature presented by the fantastic panorama that stretched itself out in endless lengths beneath their wondering eyes .

" he ' s no englishman , " said m ' nicholl , glad to have an opportunity of coming off with some credit . " he is the famous scotch engineer who invented the steam hammer , the steam ram , and discovered the ' willow leaves ' in the sun ' s disc . "
in a short time he was as unconscious as the captain .
ardan gazed on the pair for a few minutes , and then began to feel quite lonely . even his animals were fast asleep . he tried to look out , but observing without having anybody to listen to your observations , is dull work . he looked again at the sleeping pair , and then he gave in .
" wait till i give the word , " said barbican , pulling out his chronometer .
ardan was the first to recover from the deadening shock : his <unk> came to his relief .
" certainly ; that branch of it which breaks on the western shores of north america and then flows southeast towards the isthmus of panama . "
" it ' s they ! " had exclaimed the little midshipman , and the cry had thrilled every heart on board as with an electric shock . everybody had instantly understood it . everybody had felt it to be true . nothing could be more certain than that the meteor which had just flashed before their eyes was the famous projectile of the baltimore gun club . nothing could be truer than that it contained the three world renowned men and that it now lay in the black depths of the pacific ocean .
" they ' re burned to a <unk> ! " shrieked the crowd .
things were in this feverish state on the evening of the 4 th , when , all at once , bloomsbury ' s dispatch arrived in baltimore . i need not say that it dropped like a spark in a keg of gun powder . the first question all asked was : is it genuine or <unk> ? real or got up by the <unk> ? but a few flashes backwards and forwards over the wires soon settled that point . the <unk> effects of the new blow were hardly over when the <unk> began to perceive that the wonderful intelligence was decidedly in their favor . was it not a distinct contradiction of the whole story told by their opponents ? if barbican and his friends were lying at the bottom of the pacific , they were certainly not <unk> around the moon . if it was the projectile that had broken off the bowsprit of the susquehanna , it could not certainly be the projectile that belfast had seen only the day previous doing the duty of a satellite . did not the truth of one incident render the other an absolute impossibility ? if bloomsbury was right , was not belfast an ass ? hurrah !
here a fresh locomotive and a <unk> car taking charge of them , they were whirled off to omaha , reaching that busy locality at about supper time on the evening of december 6 th . the pacific train , as it was called though at that time running no further west than julesburg , instead of waiting for the regular hour of starting , fired up that very night , and was soon pulling the famous baltimore club men up the slopes of the nebraska at the rate of forty miles an hour . they were awakened before light next morning by the guard , who told them that julesburg , which they were just entering , was the last point so far reached by the rails . but their regret at this circumstance was most unexpectedly and joyfully interrupted by finding their hands warmly clasped and their names cheerily cried out by their old and beloved friend , j . t . marston , the illustrious secretary of the baltimore gun club .
" don ' t say that ! did not mr . m ' <unk> see it also ? "
" we shall see ! wait till to-night ! "
" to-night ! too late ! as far as the projectile is concerned , night is now no better than day . "
" in the pacific ocean . "
he was on his feet in an instant .
all these and many other portions of the submarine apparatus which had been employed that very year for clearing the channel , lifting the wrecks and recovering the treasure , lay now at san francisco , unused fortunately on account of the season of the year , and therefore they could be readily obtained for the asking . they had even been generously offered to captain bloomsbury , who , in obedience to a telegram from washington , had kept his crew busily employed for nearly two weeks night and day in <unk> them all safely on board the susquehanna .
" <unk> realized , with variations :
" thirty pounds , mr . marston . "
" we don ' t forget it ! we know it well ! what of it ? "
the deep , clear , calm voice that spoke next thrilled the listeners outside with an emotion that we shall not attempt to portray . except that their ears could detect in it the faintest possible emotion of triumph , it was in all respects as cool , resolute , and <unk> as ever :
chapter i
have i done right or wrong ? whether i shall have reason to regret my determination is a problem to be solved in the future . however , i will begin to record the incidents of our daily experience , dubious as i feel whether the lines of my chronicle will ever find a reader .
miss herbey is extremely pretty . her complexion is fair and her eyes deep blue , while her pleasing countenance is altogether free from that insignificance of feature which is not unfrequently alleged to be characteristic of english beauty . her mouth would be charming if she ever smiled , but , exposed as she is to the ridiculous <unk> and fancies of a capricious mistress , her lips rarely relax from their ordinary grave expression . yet , humiliating as her position must be , she never <unk> a word of open complaint , but quietly and gracefully <unk> her duties , accepting without a murmur the paltry salary which the <unk> <unk> <unk> to allow her .
great was my amazement to find the deck perfectly hot to my feet ! curtis heard my exclamation of surprise , and before i could put my thoughts into words , said :

curtis becomes captain
" oh , mr . kazallon , " he exclaimed , " if you only knew the bitterness of the agony i feel at seeing this fine vessel doomed to be devoured by flames , and at being so powerless to save her . " then quickly recovering himself , he continued : " but i am forgetting myself ; you , if no other , must know what i am suffering . it is all over now , " he said more cheerfully .
" i weighed the matter carefully for a moment , " added curtis , " and seeing what his condition too truly was , i acquiesced in all that he required and withdrew , promising him that all his orders should be obeyed . "
a short time afterward he sent for his boatswain and ordered him to assemble the crew at the foot of the main-mast . as soon as the men were together , he addressed them very calmly , but very firmly .
" true , " said i , " but what then ? "
at six o ' clock some violent blows were felt against the ship ' s side , and at the same time a voice was distinguished , shouting loudly , " curtis ! curtis ! " following the direction of the cries we saw that the broken mizzen-mast was being washed against the vessel , and in the dusky morning twilight we could make out the figure of a man clinging to the rigging . curtis , at the peril of his life , hastened to bring the man on board . it proved to be none other than silas huntly , who , after being carried overboard with the mast , had thus , almost by a miracle , escaped a watery grave . without a word of thanks to his deliverer , the ex-captain , <unk> , like an <unk> , passed on and took his seat in the most secluded corner of the poop . the broken mizzen may , perhaps , be of service to us at some future time , and with that idea it has been rescued from the waves and lashed securely to the stern .
curtis <unk> to make no other reply than a shrug of the shoulders , and turning away he informed m . letourneur and myself that if the sun came out he intended to take its altitude and find out to what part of the ocean we had been driven .
we explore the reef

after remaining nearly an hour in our newly-discovered grotto we returned to the chancellor , and communicated the result of our explorations to curtis , who entered the island upon his chart , by the name andre letourneur had proposed .
having thus <unk> his mind he relapsed into silence , and soon went away .

in the afternoon the sky became slightly <unk> , and the heat consequently less oppressive . the swell made it more difficult for the raft to keep its balance , and we shipped two or three heavy seas ; but the carpenter managed to make with some planks a kind of wall about a couple of feet high , which protected us from the direct action of the waves . our casks of food and water were secured to the raft with double ropes , for we dared not run the risk of their being carried overboard , an accident that would at once have reduced us to the <unk> distress .
" mr . kazallon , " she said to me this morning , " that young man gets manifestly weaker every day . "


one evidence of the degree to which our spirits were revived was that our minds were no longer fixed upon the miserable present and hopeless future , but we began to recall and discuss the past ; and m . letourneur , andre , mr . falsten and i , held a long conversation with the captain about the various incidents of our eventful voyage , speaking of our lost companions , of the fire , or the stranding of the ship , of our sojourn on ham rock , of the springing of the leak , of our terrible voyage in the top-masts , of the construction of the raft , and of the storm . all these things seemed to have happened so long ago , and yet we were living still . living , did i say ? ay , if such an existence as ours could be called a life , fourteen of us were living still . who would be the next to go ? we should then be thirteen .
" those villainous sharks have eaten every morsel of my bait , " he said , in a <unk> voice .
at the risk of being devoured by the sharks , the boatswain and two sailors took a morning bath , and as their plunge seemed to freshen them , i and three of my companions resolved to follow their example . we had never learned to swim , and had to be fastened to the end of a rope and lowered into the water , while curtis , during the half hour of our bath , kept a sharp lookout to give warning of any danger from approaching sharks . no recommendation , however , on our part , nor any representation of the benefit we felt we had derived , could induce miss herbey to allay her sufferings in the same way .

jynxstrop , the negro , has broken loose from his confinement , but curtis has taken no measures for putting him again under restraint . it is not to be apprehended that the miserable fellow and his accomplices , weakened as they are by their protracted fast , will attempt to do us any mischief now .
suddenly , without speaking , the boatswain raised his hand and pointed to a dark mass skimming along the surface of the water , and making straight in our direction . it was a shark , certainly not less than twelve feet long . as soon as the creature was about four fathoms from the raft , the boatswain gently drew in his line until the whirl was in such a position that the shark must cross right over it ; at the same time he shook the line a little , that he might give the whirl the appearance , if he could , of being something alive and moving . as the creature came near , my heart beat violently ; i could see its eyes flashing above the waves ; and its gaping jaws , as it turned half over on its back , exhibited long rows of pointed teeth .

happily this hope was destined to be realized ; for in a very short time , dowlas , with a shout of delight , declared that rain was actually coming ; and sure enough , not half a mile from the raft , the dark parallel streaks against the sky testified that there at least rain was falling . i fancied i could see the drops rebounding from the surface of the water . the wind was fresh and bringing the cloud right on toward us , yet we could not suppress our <unk> lest it should exhaust itself before it reached us .

there , exactly as we had seen it for the last six weeks , was the circle that bounded sea and sky - unbroken , definite , distinct as ever ! curtis gazed with <unk> scrutiny , but did not speak a word . i pitied him sincerely , for he alone of us all felt that he had not the right to put an end to his misery . for myself , i had fully determined that if i lived till the following day , i would die by my own hand . whether my companions were still alive , i hardly cared to know ; it seemed as though days had passed since i had seen them .
the raft was brought to land in latitude 0 deg . 10 ' north , so that since we abandoned the chancellor we had drifted at least fifteen degrees to the southwest . except for the influence of the gulf stream we must have been carried far , far to the south , and in that case we should never have reached the mouth of the amazon , and must inevitably have been lost .
" how long ago was that ? "
the czar frowned . perhaps the chief of police feared that he had gone rather too far , though the <unk> of his ideas was at least equal to the boundless devotion he felt for his master . but the czar , disdaining to reply to these <unk> reproaches cast on his policy , continued his questions . " where was ogareff last heard of ? "
" at perm itself . "
" he appeared <unk> , and there was nothing suspicious in his conduct . "
peter strogoff had , however , passed the fatal number without even a scratch . from that time , his son michael , aged eleven years , never failed to accompany him to the hunt , carrying the <unk> or spear to aid his father , who was armed only with the knife . when he was fourteen , michael strogoff had killed his first bear , quite alone - that was nothing ; but after <unk> it he dragged the gigantic animal ' s skin to his father ' s house , many versts distant , exhibiting remarkable strength in a boy so young .
" the grand duke is at irkutsk . "
the train in which michael took his place was to set him down at nijni-novgorod . there terminated at that time , the iron road which , uniting moscow and st . petersburg , has since been continued to the russian frontier . it was a journey of under three hundred miles , and the train would accomplish it in ten hours . once arrived at nijni-novgorod , strogoff would either take the land route or the steamer on the volga , so as to reach the ural mountains as soon as possible .
" without doubt , " thought he , " she must have determined on undertaking her journey before the invasion . perhaps she is even now ignorant of what is happening . but no , that cannot be ; the merchants discussed before her the disturbances in siberia - and she did not seem surprised . she did not even ask an explanation . she must have known it then , and knowing it , is still resolute . poor girl ! her motive for the journey must be urgent indeed ! but though she may be brave - and she certainly is so - her strength must fail her , and , to say nothing of dangers and obstacles , she will be unable to endure the fatigue of such a journey . never can she reach irkutsk ! "
it is scarcely possible truly to portray the moving mass of human beings <unk> here and there , the excitement , the confusion , the hubbub ; demonstrative as were the natives and the inferior classes , they were completely <unk> by their visitors . there were merchants from central asia , who had occupied a year in escorting their merchandise across its vast plains , and who would not again see their shops and <unk> for another year to come . in short , of such importance is this fair of nijni-novgorod , that the sum total of its transactions amounts yearly to nearly a hundred million dollars .
" all russian subjects are forbidden to leave the province ; " if ivan ogareff was still in the province , this would at any rate prevent him , unless with the greatest difficulty , from rejoining feofar-khan , and becoming a very formidable lieutenant to the tartar chief .
it must again be repeated - for it was a necessary aggravation of these severe measures - that to all those nomads chiefly concerned in the order of expulsion even the steppes of siberia were forbidden , and they would be obliged to hasten to the south of the caspian sea , either to persia , turkey , or the plains of turkestan . the post of the ural , and the mountains which form , as it were , a prolongation of the river along the russian frontier , they were not allowed to pass . they were therefore under the necessity of traveling six hundred miles before they could tread a free soil .
chapter vii going down the volga
" it is so said , sangarre ; but either this courier will arrive too late , or he will not arrive at all . "
but to what sort of a vehicle should he harness his horses ? to a telga or to a tarantass ? the telga is nothing but an open <unk> cart , made entirely of wood , the pieces fastened together by means of strong rope . nothing could be more primitive , nothing could be less comfortable ; but , on the other hand , should any accident happen on the way , nothing could be more easily repaired . there is no want of firs on the russian frontier , and <unk> grow naturally in forests . the post extraordinary , known by the name of " <unk> , " is carried by the telga , as any road is good enough for it . it must be confessed that sometimes the ropes which fasten the concern together break , and whilst the hinder part remains stuck in some bog , the <unk> arrives at the post-house on two wheels ; but this result is considered quite satisfactory .
" do not be afraid , nadia ! " cried michael strogoff .
the enormous mass as it passed grazed his chest , taking away his breath as though it had been a cannon-ball , then crushing to powder the flints on the road , it bounded into the abyss below .
" why not ? " cried michael . " ought not we do for them what they would for us under similar circumstances ? "
" i will go , too , brother , " said the young girl .
" exactly so , mr . korpanoff ; and we may possibly meet there . "
" i am sorry , sir , extremely sorry ; we must only regret that we shall separate so soon ! but on leaving ekaterenburg it may be our fortunate fate to travel together , if only for a few days ? "
" all right , my friend , " said alcide , who understood the <unk> , " we will pay double . "
at this reply all burst into a laugh .
thus nadia thought of michael . she thanked god for having given her such a gallant protector , a friend so generous and wise . she knew that she was safe with him , under his protection . no brother could have done more than he . all obstacles seemed cleared away ; the performance of her journey was but a matter of time .
here began the regular siberian steppe which extends to the neighborhood of krasnoiarsk . it is a boundless plain , a vast grassy desert ; earth and sky here form a circle as distinct as that traced by a sweep of the compasses . the steppe presents nothing to attract notice but the long line of the telegraph posts , their wires <unk> in the breeze like the strings of a <unk> . the road could be distinguished from the rest of the plain only by the clouds of fine dust which rose under the wheels of the tarantass . had it not been for this white <unk> , which stretched away as far as the eye could reach , the travelers might have thought themselves in a desert .
" no , " answered michael .
michael remained silent all the evening . the postmaster not being able to supply them with fresh horses until the next morning , a whole night must be passed at the house . nadia could profit by it to take some rest , and a room was therefore prepared for her .
at the different relays at which they stopped during the day strogoff ascertained that the berlin still preceded them on the road to irkutsk , and that the traveler , as hurried as they were , never lost a minute in pursuing his way across the steppe .
" he is a courier of the czar ? "
" who , then , was that young man whom thou <unk> call thy son a few moments ago at the posting-house ? "
michael strogoff urged on his horse , <unk> him with all his own feverish impatience , requiring of him one thing only , namely , to bear him rapidly to the next posting-house , where he could be exchanged for a quicker conveyance .
when michael strogoff perceived that his horse , tired out , was on the point of succumbing , he halted at one of these wretched hamlets , and there , forgetting his own fatigue , he himself rubbed the wounds of the poor animal with hot grease according to the siberian custom ; then he gave him a good feed ; and it was only after he had well <unk> and provided for him that he thought of himself , and recruited his strength by a hasty meal of bread and meat and a glass of <unk> . one hour afterwards , or at the most two , he resumed with all speed the interminable road to irkutsk .
without drawing <unk> , michael extended his revolver , and took a moment ' s aim . the usbeck officer , hit in the breast , rolled on the ground .
he was not more than half a verst from kolyvan when he observed flames shooting up among the houses of the town , and the steeple of a church fell in the midst of clouds of smoke and fire . was the struggle , then , in kolyvan ? michael was compelled to think so . it was evident that russians and tartars were fighting in the streets of the town . was this a time to seek refuge there ? would he not run a risk of being taken prisoner ? should he succeed in escaping from kolyvan , as he had escaped from omsk ? he hesitated and stopped a moment . would it not be better to try , even on foot , to reach some small town , and there procure a horse at any price ? this was the only thing to be done ; and michael , leaving the obi , went forward to the right of kolyvan .
" i don ' t know . "
" for the government ? "
it was two o ' clock in the afternoon , on the 2 th of august , under a hot sun and cloudless sky , that the <unk> gave the order to start .
" and , " said marfa , raising her head and looking at nadia as though she would read the depths of her heart , " in that hour of humiliation did you not despise this nicholas korpanoff ? "
" no , " answered nadia , " no , he was not . "
michael strogoff , who now naturally thought of escape , saw , after carefully surveying the situation , that under these conditions it was perfectly impossible ; so , not wishing to compromise himself , he waited .
during that night , michael was twenty times on the point of looking for and joining his mother ; but he knew that he must resist the longing he felt to take her in his arms , and once more press the hand of his young companion . the least imprudence might be fatal . he had besides sworn not to see his mother . once at tomsk , since he could not escape this very night , he would set off without having even embraced the two beings in whom all the happiness of his life was <unk> , and whom he should leave exposed to so many perils .
the executioner appeared . this time , he held his saber bare in his hand , and this saber he had just drawn from the chafing-dish , where he had brought it to a white heat . michael was going to be blinded in the tartar fashion , with a hot blade passed before his eyes !
ivan ogareff slowly approached michael , who , feeling him coming , drew himself up . ivan drew from his pocket the imperial letter , he opened it , and with supreme irony he held it up before the <unk> eyes of the czar ' s courier , saying , " read , now , michael strogoff , read , and go and repeat at irkutsk what you have read . the true courier of the czar is ivan ogareff . "
at the sound of his voice , michael said to himself that he had heard it before . and it was satisfactory to him to recognize the man for his brow at once cleared .
" i ? " cried nicholas . " i am now going to have one of my dreams realized - that of sailing in a cart . "
there the danger was great . the kibitka no longer drifted , but spun rapidly round , inclining towards the center of the eddy , like a rider in a circus . the horse could scarcely keep his head above water , and ran a great risk of being suffocated . serko had been obliged to take refuge in the carriage .
michael ' s anxiety may be imagined . he could no longer doubt that a party of tartars had recently passed that way , and yet it was impossible that they could be the emir ' s soldiers , for they could not have passed without being seen . but then , who were these new invaders , and by what out-of-the-way path across the steppe had they been able to join the highroad to irkutsk ? with what new enemies was the czar ' s courier now to meet ?
by ogareff ' s advice , in order to assure the success of the invasion in the eastern provinces , this column had skirted the base of the altai mountains . pillaging and ravaging , it had reached the upper course of the yenisei . there , <unk> what had been done at krasnoiarsk by order of the czar , and to facilitate the passage of the river to the emir ' s troops , this column had launched a flotilla of boats , which would enable feofar to cross and resume the road to irkutsk . having done this , it had descended the valley of the yenisei and struck the road on a level with <unk> . from this little town began the frightful course of ruin which forms the chief part of tartar warfare . nijni-oudinsk had shared the common fate , and the tartars , to the number of fifty thousand , had now quitted it to take up a position before irkutsk . before long , they would be reinforced by the emir ' s troops .
" yes , michael . "
could michael strogoff still be that man ?
to those who questioned him , michael strogoff said nothing of what had taken place at tomsk . he gave himself out as an inhabitant of krasnoiarsk , who had not been able to get to irkutsk before the emir ' s troops arrived on the left bank of the dinka , and he added that , very probably , the bulk of the tartar forces had taken up a position before the siberian capital .
" but they must have a chief , " said the grand duke , " who will he be ? "
" do you consent to be placed at their head ? "
the grand duke advanced quickly to his aide-de-camp . " this courier ! " he exclaimed .
" none ; unless it is to be allowed to fight at the side of your highness , " replied ogareff .
it was michael strogoff . michael had heard nadia ' s call . guided by her voice , he had just in time reached ivan ogareff ' s room , and entered by the open door .
" wonderful ! " he cried , tapping his forehead . " wonderful - wonderful ! "
" sit down , " he said , quite fiercely , " and write to my dictation . "
the dictation commenced with the following incomprehensible result :
" i have made a very important discovery . "
" but is it not well-known that heat increases one degree for every seventy feet you descend into the earth ? which gives a fine idea of the central heat . all the matters which compose the globe are in a state of incandescence ; even gold , platinum , and the hardest rocks are in a state of fusion . what would become of us ? "
" so you have come to meet me , " she said ; " how good of you . but what is the matter ? "
our voyage to iceland
it was not an easy matter to lose oneself in the two streets of reykjavik ; i had therefore no need to ask my way . the town lies on a flat and marshy plain , between two hills . a vast field of lava skirts it on one side , falling away in terraces towards the sea . on the other hand is the large bay of <unk> , bordered on the north by the enormous glacier of sneffels , and in which bay the <i>valkyrie< / i> was then the only vessel at anchor . generally there were one or two english or french <unk> , to watch and protect the fisheries in the offing . they were now , however , absent on duty .
" yes , sir , all this is true , but his works ? "
" yes , yes , all is clear , i see the link in the chain ; everything is explained , and i now understand why arne saknussemm , put out of court , forced to hide his magnificent discoveries , was compelled to conceal beneath the veil of an incomprehensible cryptograph , the secret - "
" of course . but still it cannot be done . "
but my uncle was in no humor to wait . he dug his heels into the sides of his steed , and made for the shore . his horse went to the very edge of the water , <unk> at the approaching wave and retreated .
we were introduced into our chamber , a kind of large room with a hard earthen floor , and lighted by a window , the panes of which were made of a sort of parchment from the <unk> of sheep - very far from transparent .
i obeyed mechanically .
the huge volcano which was the first stage of our daring experiment is above five thousand feet high . sneffels is the termination of a long range of volcanic mountains , of a different character to the system of the island itself . one of its peculiarities is its two huge pointed summits . from whence we started it was impossible to make out the real outlines of the peak against the grey field of sky . all we could distinguish was a vast dome of white , which fell downwards from the head of the giant .
if so , if this were true , away with the theories of sir humphry davy ; away with the authority of the parchment of arne saknussemm ; the wonderful pretensions to discovery on the part of my uncle - and to our journey !
as for the professor , after a rapid examination of their disposition and characteristics , he became breathless and panting . he ran from one to the other like a delighted <unk> , gesticulating wildly , and uttering incomprehensible and <unk> phrases in all sorts of languages .
suddenly the professor uttered a wild , unearthly cry . at first i imagined he had lost his footing , and was falling headlong into one of the yawning gulfs . nothing of the kind . i saw him , his arms spread out to their widest extent , his legs stretched apart , standing upright before an enormous pedestal , high enough and black enough to bear a gigantic statue of pluto . his attitude and mien were that of a man utterly stupefied . but his stupefaction was speedily changed to the wildest joy .
this was a very excellent proposition , and no doubt , a correct one . going down appeared to me easy enough ; it was the coming up again that now occupied my thoughts .
while we were seated on this extraordinary bench i ventured once more to look downwards . with a sigh i discovered that the bottom was still wholly invisible . were we , then , going direct to the interior of the earth ?
hans , who carried the second apparatus , had it also put into operation . this ingenious application of electricity to practical purposes enabled us to move along by the light of an artificial day , amid even the flow of the most inflammable and combustible gases .
but that which served as steps under our feet became in other places stalactites . the lava , very porous in certain places , took the form of little round <unk> . crystals of opaque quartz , adorned with limpid drops of natural glass suspended to the roof like <unk> , seemed to take fire as we passed beneath them . one would have fancied that the <unk> of romance were illuminating their underground palaces to receive the sons of men .
hans and my uncle , leaning against the wall , tried to <unk> away at some pieces of biscuit , while deep groans and sighs escaped from my scorched and swollen lips . then i fell off into a kind of deep lethargy .
" the master ! " i cried , beside myself with fury - " madman ! no - i tell you he is not the master of our lives ; we must fly ! we must drag him with us ! do you hear me ? do you understand me , i say ? "

remember that i am writing this after the journey .
the light of our ruhmkorff ' s coil , increased tenfold by the myriad of prismatic masses of rock , sent its jets of fire in every direction , and i could fancy myself traveling through a huge hollow diamond , the rays of which produced myriads of extraordinary effects .
during a long , long , weary hour , there crossed my wildly delirious brain all sorts of reasons as to what could have aroused our quiet and faithful guide . the most absurd and ridiculous ideas passed through my head , each more impossible than the other . i believe i was either half or wholly mad .
and nobody else , i think , would have done so . such a process , simple as it seemed , would most certainly not have entered our heads . nothing could be more dangerous than to begin to work with pickaxes in that particular part of the globe . supposing while he was at work a break-up were to take place , and supposing the torrent once having gained an inch were to take an <unk> , and come pouring bodily through the broken rock !
" never mind , " i continued , " let us fill our <unk> and gourds , and then try to stop the opening up . "
" well , i suppose not , except it may be a certain amount of pain in the ears , " was my rather grim reply .
then i understood it all . in order to make myself heard , i too must speak as it were along the side of the gallery , which would carry the sound of my voice just as the wire carries the electric fluid from point to point .
" where are you ? "
when i returned to the consciousness of existence , i found myself surrounded by a kind of <unk> , lying on some thick and soft coverlets . my uncle was watching - his eyes fixed intently on my countenance , a grave expression on his face , a tear in his eye . at the first sigh which struggled from my bosom , he took hold of my hand . when he saw my eyes open and fix themselves upon his , he uttered a loud cry of joy . " he lives ! he lives ! "
" god <unk> , " he said .
" well said , my boy - very well said ; it is indeed a mighty <unk> . but you would also be within the bounds of reason and common sense , if you added that it is also a vast menagerie . "
i looked rather anxiously around . if the animals were as exaggerated as the plants , the matter would certainly be serious .
" i should hear ? "
" what is the matter , harry ? " said my uncle suddenly .
" what matters that ? " cried my uncle . " i am not vexed at the rate we go at , but i am annoyed to find the sea so much <unk> than i expected . "
" teeth ! " cried i , with stupefaction , as i examined the bar of iron with more attention .

" there , " replied my uncle .
" go ahead , " said my uncle .
there is a constant <unk> of light from the storm clouds ; the electric matter is incessantly released ; evidently the gaseous principles of the air are out of order ; innumerable columns of water rush up like waterspouts , and fall back upon the surface of the ocean in foam .
next day when i awoke the change was magical . the weather was magnificent . air and sea , as if by mutual consent , had regained their serenity . every trace of the storm , even the faintest , had disappeared . i was saluted on my awakening by the first joyous tones i had heard from the professor for many a day . his gaiety , indeed , was something terrible .
the extreme <unk> of the light enabled me to see the smallest objects in the distant <unk> . i thought i saw - no , i really did see with my own eyes - immense , gigantic animals moving about under the mighty trees . yes , they were truly gigantic animals , a whole herd of <unk> , not <unk> , but living , and exactly like those discovered in 1800 , on the marshy banks of the great ohio , in north america .
" not at all . there is a very simple explanation , harry . the icelanders are known to keep up the use of these <unk> weapons , and this must have belonged to hans , who has let it fall without knowing it . "
by a vigorous application of his pole hans sent us flying over the water . the raft was quite twenty fathoms distant .
my uncle , the professor , made no reply other than a gesture of rage and despair .
yes , wholly <unk> staring mad . the needle jumped from pole to pole with sudden and surprising jerks , ran round , or as it is said , <unk> the compass , and then ran suddenly back again as if it had the vertigo .
nothing could be more true . at the exact minute he had indicated , we were again launched on high with extreme rapidity . not to be cast off the raft , it was necessary to hold on to the beams . then the hoist again ceased .
i thought for a moment of the <unk> joy of suddenly finding myself in the hyperborean regions with the cold thirty degrees below zero !
i could not believe my eyes , but the actual heat which affected my body allowed me no chance of doubting . we came out of the crater half naked , and the radiant star from which we had asked nothing for two months , was good enough to be prodigal to us of light and warmth - a light and warmth we could easily have dispensed with .
" but the compass ! " exclaimed my uncle ; " explain that to me ! "
my uncle played a regular accompaniment to my gestures and words . we were singing together like an ancient chorus .

" explain yourself , my boy . i am on thorns . "
nevertheless , and notwithstanding these considerations , fritz napoleon smith ' s mode of life may well astonish one . his iron constitution is taxed to the utmost by the heavy strain that is put upon it . vain the attempt to estimate the amount of labor he <unk> ; an example alone can give an idea of it . let us then go about with him for one day as he <unk> to his <unk> <unk> . what day ? that matters little ; it is the same every day . let us then take at random september 5 th of this present year 2800 .
as in the morning , the table rose out of the floor . again , as in the morning , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were supplied through the <unk> . toward the close of the meal , <unk> communication was made with paris . smith saw his wife , seated alone at the <unk> , looking anything but pleased at her loneliness .

ayrton then shoved off with pencroft in the boat .
at that moment a hand was laid on ayrton ' s shoulder .
" well , we shall soon see , pencroft , " said the engineer .
however , the mystery which enveloped its strange destruction would doubtless never have been cleared away if , on the 0 th of november , neb , strolling on the beach , had not found a piece of a thick iron cylinder , bearing traces of explosion . the edges of this cylinder were twisted and broken , as if they had been subjected to the action of some explosive substance .
" that is settled , then , " said cyrus harding . " we will begin our researches as soon as possible . we will not leave a corner of the island unexplored . we will search into its most secret recesses , and will hope that our unknown friend will pardon us in consideration of our intentions ! "
herbert was placed on his left side , and was maintained in that position .
" yes , top will go , " said the reporter , who had understood the engineer . " top can go where we cannot ! he will carry to granite house the news of the corral , and he will bring back to us that from granite house ! "
" if he is dead , " added pencroft , in a peculiar tone .
" or ayrton ? "
the night passed without any important change . herbert was somewhat delirious , but the fever did not reappear in the night , and did not return either during the following day .
it was five in the morning . the rays of the rising sun began to shine in at the windows of granite house . it promised to be a fine day , and this day was to be poor herbert ' s last !
the colonists remained , therefore , near the cart , and carefully watched the neighbouring parts of the forest .
they were those of the convicts who , four months previously , had landed on lincoln island !
on the 1 th of november , two of the villains , surprised by the colonists ' arrival , fired at herbert , and one of them returned , boasting of having killed one of the inhabitants of the island ; but he returned alone . his companion , as is known , fell by cyrus harding ' s dagger .
matters remained thus until the third week of february . the convicts , still watching for a favourable opportunity , rarely quitted their retreat , and only made a few hunting excursions , either to the interior of the island , or the south coast .
" the severe cold experienced in lincoln island , " said gideon spilett , " may then perhaps be explained by the presence of floes or icebergs comparatively near to lincoln island . "
there was no one there . everything was in the state in which it had been left .
the thunder continued to roar with such violence that not a word could be heard . however , there was no occasion for speaking , but to get forward as fast as possible .
thus they almost unconsciously descended this ravine , which even in broad daylight would have been considered impracticable .
there was some time to wait . the colonists remained silently crouching in a deep hollow . rain now began to fall in torrents . the thunder was re-echoed among the rocks with a grand sonorousness .
at a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof , supported on basalt shafts . irregular arches , strange <unk> , appeared on the columns erected by nature in thousands from the first epochs of the formation of the globe . the basalt pillars , fitted one into the other , measured from forty to fifty feet in height , and the water , calm in spite of the tumult outside , washing their base . the brilliant focus of light , pointed out by the engineer , touched every point of rock , and flooded the walls with light . by reflection the water reproduced the brilliant <unk> , so that the boat appeared to be floating between two glittering zones .
for a long time after this , captain nemo continued to live thus , traversing every sea . but one by one his companions died , and found their last resting-place in their cemetery of coral , in the bed of the pacific . at last captain nemo remained the solitary survivor of all those who had taken refuge with him in the depths of the ocean .
he was now sixty years of age . although alone , he succeeded in navigating the nautilus towards one of those submarine caverns which had sometimes served him as a harbour .
" what think you of my life , gentlemen ? "
" gentlemen , " resumed the captain , " to-morrow i shall be dead . "
the colonists mounted the platform , which rose seven or eight feet above the water . there they beheld a thick glass lenticular covering , which protected a kind of large eye , from which flashed forth light . behind this eye was apparently a cabin containing the wheels of the rudder , and in which was stationed the helmsman , when he navigated the nautilus over the bed of the ocean , which the electric rays would evidently light up to a considerable distance .

" well , then ! " said pencroft , " are we not going back to work ? let mount franklin smoke , groan , <unk> , or spout forth fire and flame as much as it pleases , that is no reason why we should be idle ! come , ayrton , neb , herbert , captain harding , mr spilett , every one of us must turn to at our work to-day ! we are going to place the <unk> , and a dozen pair of hands would not be too many . before two months i want our new bonadventure - for we shall keep the old name , shall we not ? - to float on the waters of port balloon ! therefore there is not an hour to lose ! "
" the crater is on fire ! " said herbert , who , more active than his companions , first reached the plateau .
" my friends , " he said , and his voice betrayed the depth of his emotion , " our island is not among those which will endure while this earth <unk> . it is doomed to more or less speedy destruction , the cause of which it bears within itself , and from which nothing can save it . "
nevertheless it was a fortunate circumstance for the colonists that the effusion of lava should have been in the direction of lake grant . they had before them some days ' respite . the plateau of prospect heights , granite house , and the dockyard were for the moment preserved . and these few days it was necessary to employ them in planking , carefully <unk> the vessel , and launching her . the colonists would then take refuge on board the vessel , content to rig her after she should be afloat on the waters . with the danger of an explosion which threatened to destroy the island there could be no security on shore . the walls of granite house , once so sure a retreat , might at any moment fall in upon them .

shandon pointed his telescope in the direction indicated , and confirmed the pilot ' s announcement .
" i mean that for some reason or other there are spirits on board , and i know they don ' t go without in the stern . "
" with the commander ' s permission , " replied johnson , " i should do nothing of the kind . "
on the 1st of may , at noon , they were in 60 degrees latitude and 50 degrees 30 minutes longitude . the temperature was higher and the thermometer marked twenty-five degrees above zero . the doctor was amusing himself with watching the <unk> of a white bear and two <unk> on the brink of a pack that lengthened out the land . accompanied by wall and simpson , he tried to give chase to them by means of the canoe ; but the animal , of a rather warlike disposition , rapidly led away its <unk> , and consequently the doctor was compelled to renounce following them up .
" i ' ll take charge of him , " answered pen furiously .
" ay ! ay ! " answered all the sailors .
" if i were not a frenchman i should like to be an englishman . "
" well , to finish all i know about james ross : he tried to reach melville island by a more westerly direction , but he nearly lost his two vessels , for he was caught by the ice and driven back into baffin ' s sea . "
" veer to the west , all steam on . "
" but , if i am not mistaken , the captain counts upon renewing his stock of coal at beechey island . it appears there is a large provision there . "
" but perhaps he would listen to the crew . "
chapter xix
" who spoke ? " cried hatteras .
" you never mind , gripper , " answered pen ; " we ' ll have a captain and a good one - that mr . shandon knows . when one commander goes mad , folks have done with him , and they take another ; don ' t they , mr . shandon ? "
" all hands on deck ! " cried the captain .
chapter xxvi
" he is a strange man , " said the doctor to johnson ; " he even astonishes me . he is one of the most powerful natures i have ever studied in my life . "
" you know , bell , we can ' t depend on the seals ; they ' ve disappeared for a good while to come ; if the bears don ' t come to be turned into fuel too , i don ' t know what will become of us . "
" i mean , " said hatteras gravely , " to require every man to do his duty to the end . "
" hatteras , we shall all die if we get no fuel . "
" are you hurt ? " asked hatteras .
" ah , mr . clawbonny , i shall never get over it . i wish i was dead already . "
" pass it round ! " said a voice as if they were dealing with a picture or a vase .
no ! and at the outset it was only necessary to look at william w . kolderup to feel convinced that he could never yield on a question where his financial <unk> was at stake .
" if we must part , it had better be before marriage than afterwards ! "
chapter v .
professor tartlet , generally so firm on his limbs , had lost all his dancing equilibrium . he had lost all his usual self-possession , and tried in vain to recover it ; he even tottered on the carpet of his room as if he were already on the floor of a cabin , rolling and pitching on the ocean .
" i mean that in order not to endanger the vessel ' s safety i have had to put her about and run before the storm . "
" yes ! our <unk> saw from the whiteness of the sea that there were some breakers away to the east ; breakers which are not shown on the chart . so the steam launch was got out , and with the boatswain and three men , captain turcott has gone off to explore . "

godfrey continued his walk for a quarter of an hour . at last he was about to turn on to the <unk> of the most elevated of the dunes , dotted with rushes and brushwood , when he suddenly stopped .
it was the sea which formed it . twenty miles off it united with the line of the sky !
the bay at the bottom of which the dream lay shipwrecked was the only one of any size , and that extended over some seven or eight miles . an open roadstead , no vessel would have found it a safe shelter , at least unless the wind was blowing from the east .
but what was this island ? to what geographical group did it belong ? did it form part of an archipelago , or was it alone in this portion of the pacific ?
this was to be looked into on the morrow .

however , he kept on , and each time he reached a projection he would stop and take breath .
the smoke got bigger and bigger . it increased when the steamer <unk> her fires , and diminished almost to <unk> as the fuel was consumed . continually did the vessel visibly approach . about four o ' clock her hull had come up on the line between the sky and the sea .
godfrey looked in the direction pointed out .
it was not a fleet , as the distracted tartlet had said ; but he was only mistaken about the quantity .
he then examined with extreme attention the little vessel , which would ere then have perceived the flag on flag point as it fluttered in the breeze .
the glass fell from his hands .
the danger of being found was thus great . godfrey regretted that he had hoisted the flag , which had not been seen by the ship , but would be by these black fellows . to take it down now would be too late .
" hunted perhaps ! " exclaimed tartlet .
they did nothing . it did not even seem as though they saw him ; but at this moment the chief made a significant gesture . three of his companions went towards the prisoner , <unk> him , and forced him near the fire .
" if that is his name , " said godfrey ; " why should he not keep it ? "
chapter xix .
in which tartlet <unk> in every key that he would rather be off .
but what was to be done ?
the winter season , so severe in these latitudes , had come at last . the first frosts had already been felt , and there was every promise of rigorous weather . godfrey was to be congratulated on having established his fireplace in the tree . it need scarcely be said that the work at the palisade had been completed , and that a sufficiently solid door now assured the <unk> of the fence .
godfrey stopped him .
thence they beheld , without the power of interference , the horrible massacre which was taking place in the gloom . the cries of the sheep and the goats gradually diminished as the slaughter of the animals was <unk> , although the greater part had escaped outside , where death , none the less certain , awaited them . this loss was irreparable for the little colony ; but godfrey was not then anxious about the future . the present was disquieting enough to occupy all his thoughts .
there was nothing they could do , nothing they could try , to hinder this work of destruction .
and , with his gun in his hand and his <unk> round his waist , he took his post at one of the windows .
pytheas ventured still further north , and went beyond the <unk> islands to the furthest point of scotland , and he must have reached a very high latitude , for during the summer the night only lasted two hours . after six days further sailing , he came to lands which he calls thule , probably the <unk> or norway of the present day , beyond which he could not pass , for he says , " there was neither land , sea , nor air there . " he retraced his course , and changing it slightly , he came to the mouth of the rhine , to the country of the <unk> , and , further inland , to germany . thence he visited the mouth of the <unk> , that is supposed to be the <unk> or the <unk> , and he <unk> to marseilles , just a year after leaving his native town . pytheas , besides being such a brave sailor , was a remarkably scientific man : he was the first to discover the influence that the moon exercises on the tides , and to notice that the polar star is not situated at the exact spot at which the axis of the globe is supposed to be . some years after the time of pytheas , about b . c . 300 a greek traveller made his name famous . this was nearchus , a native of <unk> , one of alexander ' s <unk> , and he was charged to visit all the coast of asia from the mouth of the indus to that of the euphrates . when alexander first resolved that this expedition should take place , which had for its object the opening up of a communication between india and egypt , he was at the upper part of the indus . he furnished nearchus with a fleet of thirty-three <unk> , of some vessels with two decks , and a great number of transport ships , and 2000 men . nearchus came down the indus in about four months , escorted on either bank of the river by alexander ' s armies , and after spending seven months in exploring the delta , he set sail and followed the west line of what we call <unk> in the present day .
some days after this they came to the mouth of the river <unk> , that separates persia from <unk> , and thence they reached a large lake situated in the country now called <unk> , and finally anchored near the village of <unk> , at the source of the euphrates , having accomplished their project of visiting all the coast lying between the euphrates and indus . nearchus returned a second time to alexander , who rewarded him magnificently , and placed him in command of his fleet . alexander ' s wish , that the whole of the arabian coast should be explored as far as the red sea , was never fulfilled , as he died before the expedition was arranged .

it was in the year 1200 , twenty-four years after leaving it , that marco polo and his companions returned to their native town . they were <unk> by exposure to the air and sun , <unk> clad in tartar costume , and both in manners and language were so much more mongolian than venetian , that even their nearest relatives failed to recognize them . beyond this , a report had been widely spread that they were dead , and it had gained so much credence that their friends never expected to see them again . they went to their own house in the part of venice called st . john <unk> , and found it occupied by different members of the polo family , who received the travellers with every mark of distrust , which their pitiable appearance did not tend to lessen , and placed no faith in the somewhat marvellous stories related to them by marco polo . after some persuasion , however , they gained admittance into their own house . when they had been a few days in venice , the three travellers gave a magnificent banquet , followed by a splendid fête , to do away with any remaining doubts as to their identity . they invited the nobility of venice and all the members of their own family , and when all the guests were assembled the three hosts appeared dressed in crimson satin robes ; the guests then entered the dining-room , and the feast began . after the first course was over the three travellers retired for a few moments and then reappeared , clad in robes of splendid silk <unk> , which they proceeded to tear , and to present each of their guests with a piece . after the second course they dressed themselves in even more splendid robes of crimson velvet , which they wore until the feast was over , when they appeared in simple venetian costume . the astonished guests <unk> at the magnificence of these garments , and wondered what their hosts would next show them ; then the coarse rough clothes that they had worn on the voyage were brought in , and when the <unk> and seams were undone , rubies , <unk> , emeralds , diamonds , and <unk> of great value were poured forth from them ; great riches had been hidden in these rags . this unexpected sight cleared away all doubt ; the three travellers were recognized at once as marco , nicolo , and matteo polo , and congratulations upon their return were showered upon them .
béthencourt remained three months in fortaventura and the other islands . he rode about among the people on his mule , and found many of the natives beginning to speak <unk> . maciot and the other gentlemen accompanied him , he pointing out what was best to be done and the most honest way of doing it . then he gave notice that he would set out for rome on the ensuing 5 th of december . returning to lancerota , he remained there till his departure , and ordered all the gentlemen he had brought with him , the workmen , and the three kings to appear before him two days before his departure , to tell them what he wished done , and to <unk> himself and them to god ' s protection .
on the 4 th of august , 1400 , diaz returned to <unk> <unk> <unk> , where he had left his smallest caravel . he found six of his nine men dead , and the seventh was so overcome with joy at seeing his companions again that he died also . no particular incident marked the voyage home ; they reached lisbon in december , 1400 , after staying at benin , where they traded , and at la mina to receive the money gained by the commerce of the colony .
it is strange but true , that diaz not only received no reward of any kind for this voyage which had been so successful , but he seemed to be treated rather as though he had disgraced himself , for he was not employed again for ten years . more than this the command of the expedition that was sent to double the cape which diaz had discovered , was given to vasco da gama , and diaz was only to accompany it to la mina holding a subordinate position . he was to hear of the marvellous campaign of his successful rival in india , and to see what an effect such an event would have upon the destiny of his country .
in fact it was only in 1400 , maybe five years after the discovery of america , that the southern point of africa was passed by vasco da gama , and it may be affirmed that if this latter had preceded columbus , the discovery of the new continent might have been delayed for several centuries . the navigators of this period were very timorous , and did not dare to sail out into mid-ocean ; not <unk> to venture upon seas that were but little known , they always followed the coast-line of africa , rather than go further from land . if the cape of tempests had been doubled , the sailors would have gone by this route to india , and none would have thought of going to the " land of spices , " that is to say asia , by venturing across the atlantic . who , in fact , would have thought of seeking for the east by the route to the west ? but in truth this was the great idea of that day , for cooley says , " the principal object of portuguese maritime enterprise in the fifteenth century was to search for a passage to india by the ocean . " the most learned men had not gone so far as to imagine the existence of another continent to complete the equilibrium and balance of the terrestrial globe . some parts of the american continent had been already discovered , for an italian navigator sebastian cabot had landed on labrador in 1400 , and the scandinavians had certainly disembarked on this unknown land . the colonists of greenland , too had explored <unk> , but so little disposition was there at this time to believe in the existence of a new world , that greenland , <unk> , and labrador were all thought to be a continuation of the european continent .
when columbus returned on board , several of the savages swam after his boat ; the next day , the 3 th , they came in crowds around the ships , on board of enormous canoes shaped out of the trunks of trees ; they were guided by means of a kind of <unk> ' s <unk> , and some of the canoes were capable of holding forty men . several natives wore little plates of gold hanging from their nostrils ; they appeared much surprised at the arrival of the strangers , and quite believed that these white men must have fallen from the skies . it was with a mixture of respect and curiosity that they touched the garments of the spaniards , considering them doubtless , a kind of natural plumage . the scarlet coat of the admiral excited their admiration above everything , and it was evident they looked upon columbus as a <unk> of a superior species ; at once they seemed to recognize him as the chief amongst the strangers .
meanwhile , the affairs of columbus had taken a bad turn in europe . since his departure calumnies against himself and his brothers had been ever on the increase . some rebels who had been expelled the colony , denounced the <unk> dynasty of the columbus family , thus exciting the jealousy of a vain and ungrateful monarch . even the queen , until now the constant <unk> of the genoese navigator , was indignant at the arrival on board the vessels of three hundred indians who had been torn from their country , and who were treated as slaves . isabella did not know that this abuse of power had been carried out unknown to columbus and during his absence ; he was held responsible for it , and to inquire into his conduct , the court sent to hispaniola a commander of the order of <unk> , named francis de bovadilla , to whom were given the titles of governor-general , and intendant of justice . he was in reality meant to <unk> columbus . bovadilla , invested with <unk> powers , set out with two caravels towards the end of june , 1500 . on the 20rd of august , the colonists sighted the two ships , which were then endeavouring to enter the harbour of san domingo .
the ships had sustained some damage , and fresh water was needed ; it was therefore urgent for them to find some harbour , which they succeeded in doing on the 0 th of january , 1400 . the blacks whom the portuguese saw here upon landing were people of greater stature than those whom they had hitherto met with . their arms were a large bow with long arrows , and a <unk> tipped with iron . they were <unk> , a race very superior to the bushmen . such happy relations were quickly established with them that gama gave the country the name of the land of good people ( terra da bon <unk> ) .
once more the eminent services rendered by this great man went <unk> , or rather they were not appreciated as they deserved . gama , who had just laid the foundations of the colonial empire of portugal in india , remained for one and twenty years without employment , and it was only through the <unk> of the duke of <unk> , that he obtained the title of count de <unk> . a too common instance this of ingratitude , but one which it is never <unk> à <unk> to <unk> as it deserves .
alonzo de hojeda , whose adventures we have narrated above , was the first to think of founding a colony on the mainland ; although he had no means of his own , his courage and enterprising spirit soon gained him associates , who furnished him with the funds needed for carrying out his plans .
cortès amassed the sum of 3000 <unk> in the course of a few years by his industry and <unk> , a large sum for one in his position , but his chief recommendations in the eyes of <unk> de <unk> and <unk> de <unk> his two <unk> , were his activity , his well-known prudence , his decision of character , and the power of gaining the confidence of all with whom he was brought into contact . in addition to all this , he was of imposing stature and appearance , very athletic , and possessed powers of endurance , remarkable even among the hardy adventurers who were accustomed to brave all kinds of hardships .
after twenty days of repose in this town , cortès resumed his march towards mexico , having with him an auxiliary army of six thousand tlascalans . he went first to <unk> , a town regarded as sacred by the indians , and as the sanctuary and favoured residence of their deities . montezuma felt much satisfaction in the advance of the spaniards to this town , either from the hope that the gods would themselves avenge the <unk> of their temples , or that he thought a rising , and massacre of the spaniards might be more easily organized in this populous and fanatical town . cortès had been warned by the tlascalans that he must place no trust in the protestations of friendship and devotion made by the <unk> . however , he took up his quarters in the town , considering that he would lose his prestige if he showed any signs of fear , but upon being informed by the tlascalans that the women and children were being sent away , and by <unk> that a considerable body of troops was massed at the gates of the city , that <unk> and trenches were dug in the streets , whilst the roofs of the houses were loaded with stones and missiles , cortès anticipated the designs of his enemies , gave orders to make prisoners of all the principal men of the town , and then organized a general massacre of the population , thus taken by surprise and deprived of their leaders . for two whole days the unhappy <unk> were subject to all the horrors which could be invented by the rage of the spaniards , and the vengeance of their allies the tlascalans . a terrible example was made , six thousand people being put to the sword , temples burned to the ground , and the town half destroyed , a work of destruction well calculated to strike terror into the hearts of montezuma and his subjects .
the retreat being determined upon , it was necessary to decide upon whether it should be carried out by night or by day . if in the daytime the enemy would be more easily resisted , any <unk> which might be prepared would be more easily avoided , while they could better take precautions to repair any bridges broken by the mexicans . on the other hand , it was known that the indians will seldom attack an enemy after sunset , but what really decided cortès in favour of a nocturnal retreat was , that a soldier who <unk> in <unk> had declared to his comrades that success was certain if they acted in the night .
there lived , however , in panama a man well able to weigh the truth of the reports which had been circulated concerning the richness of the countries bathed by the pacific ; this man was francisco pizarro , who had accompanied <unk> de balboa to the southern sea , and who now associated with himself two other adventurers , diego de almagro and ferdinand de luque . a few words must be said about the chiefs of the enterprise . francisco pizarro , born near truxillo between the years 1400 and 1400 , was the natural son of a certain captain gonzalo pizarro , who had taught the boy nothing but to take care of pigs ; he was soon tired of this occupation , and took advantage of his having allowed one of the animals who were in his charge to stray , not to return to the paternal roof , where he was accustomed to be cruelly beaten for the smallest <unk> . the young pizarro enlisted , and after passing some years amidst the italian wars , he followed christopher columbus to hispaniola in 1500 . he served there with distinction , and also in cuba ; afterwards he accompanied hojeda to darien , discovered , as has been already mentioned , the pacific , with balboa , and after the execution of the latter , he assisted <unk> <unk> , whose favourite he had become , in the conquest of all the country known as castille d ' or .
pizarro first made for <unk> , a small town situated at about twenty days ' march from the coast . to reach it he had to cross a desert of burning sand , without vegetation and without water , which extended for sixty miles in length as far as the province of <unk> , and where the slightest attack of the enemy , joined to the sufferings endured by the little army , would have been sufficient to crush the whole expedition at one blow . next the troops plunged into the mountains and became entangled in narrow defiles where a small force might have annihilated them . during this march pizarro received an envoy from atahualpa bringing him some painted shoes and gold bracelets , which he was requested to wear at his approaching interview with the inca . naturally pizarro was lavish in his promises of friendship and devotion , and assured the indian ambassador that he should be only following the orders given him by the king his master in respecting the lives and property of the inhabitants . from the moment of his arrival at <unk> pizarro prudently lodged his soldiers in a temple and a palace belonging to the inca , where they were sheltered from any surprise . then he sent one of his brothers with de <unk> and twenty horse-soldiers to the camp of atahualpa , which was distant only three miles , to announce to him his arrival . the envoys of the governor were received with magnificence , and were astonished at the <unk> of the ornaments and vases made of gold and silver which they saw throughout the indian camp . they returned , bringing a promise from atahualpa that he would come on the next day to visit pizarro , to bid him welcome to his kingdom . at the same time the envoys gave an account of the wonderful riches they had seen , which confirmed pizarro in the project which he had formed of seizing the unfortunate atahualpa and his treasures by treachery .

after remaining thirteen days in this place , the squadron continued its route to the south , coasting along the shore , and arrived at 30 degrees 40 minutes of south latitude in a country where flowed a large river of fresh water . it was the la plata . the natives , called <unk> , were so frightened at the sight of the vessels that they hastily took refuge in the interior of the country , carrying with them all their valuables , and it was impossible to overtake any of them . it was in this country that four years previously , juan diaz de solis had been massacred by a tribe of <unk> , armed with that terrible engine which is still in use at the present day among the gauchos of the argentine republic , the <unk> , which are metal balls fastened to the two ends of a long leather thong , called a lasso .
all that concerns john and sebastian cabot has been until recently shrouded by a mist which is not even now completely dissipated , notwithstanding the conscientious labours of <unk> the american in 1800 , and of our compatriot m . d ' avezac ; as also those of mr . nicholls the englishman , who taking advantage of the discoveries made among the english , spanish , and venetian archives , has built up an imposing monument , of which some parts , however , are open to discussion . it is from the two last-named works that we shall draw the materials for this rapid sketch , but principally from mr . nicholls ' book , which has this advantage over the smaller volume of m . d ' avezac , that it relates the whole life of sebastian cabot .
after remaining for three days in this enchanting place , the frenchmen continued to follow the coast northwards , sailing by day and casting anchor at night . as the land <unk> towards the east , they went 100 miles further in that direction , and discovered an island of triangular shape about thirty miles distant from the continent , similar in size to the island of rhodes , and upon which they bestowed the name of the mother of francis i . , <unk> of savoy . then they reached another island forty-five miles off , which possessed a magnificent harbour and of which the inhabitants came in crowds to visit the strange vessels . two kings , especially , were of fine stature and great beauty . they were dressed in <unk> , with the head bare , the hair carried back and tied in a tuft , and they wore on the neck a large chain ornamented with coloured stones . this was the most remarkable nation which they had until now met with . " the women are graceful , " says the narrative published by ramusio . " some wore the skins of the <unk> on their arms ; their head was ornamented with their plaited hair and long <unk> hung down on both sides of the chest ; others had <unk> which recalled those of the egyptian and syrian women ; only the <unk> women , and those who were married , wore <unk> in their ears of worked copper . " this land is situated on the same parallel as rome , in 40 degrees 40 minutes , but its climate is much colder .
at the beginning of may the men became somewhat impatient , and asked barentz if he were not soon intending to make the necessary preparations for departure . but barentz answered that he must wait until the end of the month , and then , if it should be impossible to set the ship free , he would take measures to prepare the <unk> and the launch , and to render them fit for a sea voyage . on the 0 th of the month the preparations for departure commenced ; with what joy and ardour it is easy to imagine . the launch was repaired , the sails were mended , and both boats were dragged to the sea , and provisions put on board . then , seeing that the water was free , and that a strong wind was blowing , heemskerke went to seek barentz , who had been long ill , and declared to him " that it seemed good to him to set out from thence , and in god ' s name to commence the voyage and abandon nova zembla . "

if we put on one side all these <unk> of an imagination run mad , what gain has been derived for geography ? there was certainly no pains spared in announcing with much noise , and very great puffing , this fantastic expedition , and we may well say with the <unk> , -
chapter v . missionaries and settlers . merchants and tourists .

setting sail from <unk> , on march 5 th , 1600 , the two chiefs of the enterprise first ascended the st . lawrence , as far as the harbour of <unk> , 200 miles from its mouth . they were welcomed by the populations , which had , however , " neither faith , nor law , and lived without god , and without religion , like brute beasts . " at this place they quitted their ships , which could not have advanced further without danger , and reached in a boat the fall of st . louis , where jacques cartier had been stopped ; they even penetrated a little into the interior , and then returned to france , where champlain printed a narrative of the voyage for the king .
<unk> noticed that the pendulum lost two minutes , twenty-eight seconds at cayenne , which proved that the <unk> was less at this place than at paris . from this fact , newton and huyghens deduced the <unk> of the globe at the poles . shortly afterwards , however , the computation of a terrestrial degree given by abbé picard , and the determination of the meridional arc , arrived at by the <unk> , father and son , led scientific men to an <unk> different result , and induced them to consider the earth an elliptical figure , elongated towards the polar regions . passionate discussions arose from this decision , and in them originated immense undertakings , from which astronomical and mathematical geography profited .
we must now speak of two important expeditions , which ought to have settled the animated discussion as to the shape of the earth . the academy of sciences had despatched a mission to america , to <unk> the arc of the meridian at the equator . it was composed of godin , bouguer , and la condamine .

if these natives were not quite so tall as the giants mentioned by previous navigators , they were very little less striking .
before we follow wallis on his voyage across the pacific , we will give a short account of the wretched natives of tierra del fuego , and of the general appearance of their country . these wretches , who were as miserable and <unk> as possible , subsisted upon the raw flesh of seals and penguins .
the captain accordingly ordered his boats to make for the shore , and the natives finding themselves disregarded , threw some sharp stones which wounded a few sailors . but the captains of the boats replied to this attack by a volley of bullets , which injured one of them , and was followed by the flight of the rest .
a painful event occurred whilst the crew were in this port . a child of about twelve years of age came on board , and glass beads and bits of glass were given to it , with no suspicion of the use to which they would be put . it would appear that these savages are in the habit of <unk> pieces of talc down their throats as <unk> . this boy no doubt meant to do the same with the glass , for when they landed they found him vomiting violently and spitting blood . his throat and gums were lacerated and bleeding . in spite of the enchantments and violent <unk> of a <unk> , or perhaps on account of this not too effective treatment , the poor child suffered dreadfully , and died shortly afterwards . this was the signal for a precipitate flight of the <unk> . they no doubt entertained a fear that the french had cast a spell upon them , and that they would all die in a similar manner .

" she will be the first woman who has been round the world , " says bougainville , " and i must do her the justice to admit that she has conducted herself with the most scrupulous discretion . she is neither ugly nor pretty , and at most is only twenty-six or twenty-seven years old . it must be admitted that had the two vessels suffered shipwreck upon a desert island , it would have been a singular experience for barré . "
it is difficult for the reader , tranquilly sitting in his <unk> , to imagine the anxiety of a voyage in these unknown seas , - threatened with the unexpected appearance of rocks and breakers , with contrary winds , unknown currents , and a fog which concealed all dangers . cape deliverance was only rounded on the 6 th . it was now possible to start for the <unk> .
two days later , when they had made about sixty leagues northward , some islands were perceived ahead . bougainville imagined they were a part of the louisiade group , but they are more generally accepted as belonging to the solomon archipelago , which carteret , who saw them the preceding year , as little imagined that he had reached , as the french navigator .
" we sent our casks on shore , " says the narrative , " and began to collect water and wood , and commence washing , all of which was most necessary . the disembarkation was splendid - upon fine sand , with neither rock nor wave .
they had been only a few days in port , when a sailor found a leaden plate upon which was an inscription in english . it was easy to guess that they had found the very spot where carteret had made a stay the preceding year .
tupia had not been credited with so much simple and true eloquence , and it surprised cook and the other english .
cook visited a pah in the neighbourhood . built upon a little island or inaccessible rock , the pah was merely a fortified village . the natives most frequently add to the natural <unk> by fortifications , which render the approach still more perilous . many were defended by a double ditch , the inner one having a parapet and double palisade . the second ditch was at least eighty feet in depth . on the inside of the palisade , at the height of twenty feet , was a raised platform forty feet long by six wide . supported on two large poles , it was intended to hold the defenders of the place , who from thence could easily overwhelm the attacking party with darts and stones , of which an enormous supply was always ready in case of need .
after a short interval the endeavour arrived at batavia , where she was repaired .

the captain afterwards visited <unk> , where the natives gave him the most <unk> welcome . they inquired with interest about tupia and the english they had seen in the endeavour . king <unk> hastened to renew his acquaintance with the captain , and gave him all the provisions his island produced . during their stay , <unk> , who had embarked in the resolution , landed with a young tahitan girl , who had enchanted him , and would not return on board . he was replaced by a young man of seventeen or eighteen years of age , a native of <unk> , named oedidi , who announced his wish to go to england . the grief evinced by this native on leaving his native land spoke well for his good heart .
however that might be , the english were at a loss to guess why the natives prevented their penetrating to the interior of the country . was it owing to a naturally shy nature ? or possibly because they were threatened with constant <unk> from their neighbours . their address in the use of arms and their bearing supported this idea , but it was impossible to know with any certainty .
the natives having heard one discharge , were encouraged by observing that a gun was not an infallible instrument , that it sometimes missed fire , and that once fired it was necessary to <unk> before firing again .
they were received with solemnity , and conducted through a crowd of men , with clubs on their shoulders , to the presence of three chiefs , whose ears were adorned with red feathers . they soon perceived a score of women , who danced in a grave and serious fashion , paying no attention to their arrival .
the two vessels afterwards reached a neighbouring island called <unk> , upon which m . gore landed to get fodder . although the ruins of houses and tents were seen , it was uninhabited .
cook had long heard that human sacrifices were common in tahiti , but he had always refused to believe it . a solemn ceremonial which he saw at <unk> , no longer allowed him to doubt the existence of the practice . in order to gain the favourable assistance of the <unk> or <unk> in an expedition against the island of <unk> , a man of the lowest social rank was killed by blows with clubs in the king ' s presence . as an offering the hair and one eye of the victim was placed before the king ; last signs of the cannibalism which formerly existed in this archipelago . at the end of this barbarous ceremony , which was a <unk> in the memoirs of so peaceable a people , a <unk> alighted in the foliage . " it is <unk> ! " cried otoo , delighted at the happy augury .
his threats were likely to be effective , as a few days earlier , some robbers , caught in the act by the english , had had their heads shaved and their ears cut . a little later at <unk> , in order to force the natives to send back some deserters , cook had carried off the entire family of the chief <unk> on one rope .
the vessels had scarcely gained the open sea when a violent tempest overtook them , during which the resolution sprung a leak on the starboard side below the water line .
is not there a strange resemblance between this legend and that relating to the mexican god <unk> , who , forced to fly from the wrath of a more powerful god , embarked upon a <unk> of serpent skin , promising those who accompanied him to return at some later time , and visit the country with his descendants ?
" the <unk> , " says cook , " was then handed round , and when we had tasted it , koah and pareea divided the flesh of the pig into several pieces , which they placed in our mouths . "
all this was a <unk> gift to the king from his subjects . terreoboo chose about a third of these articles , and gave the rest to the two captains - a more valuable present than they had ever received either at tonga or tahiti .
messrs . law and chevalier , governors in french india , determined to send a vessel at their own risk to trade in the southern seas . they admitted surville to their schemes , and sent him to france to obtain the needful authority from the company , and to superintend the equipment of the vessel .
the french pitched three camps on land . the first for the sick , upon <unk> island , the second upon the mainland , which served as a depôt , and a means of communication with the third , which was the workshop of the carpenters , and was some two leagues away in the midst of a wood . the crew , persuaded by the <unk> of the natives , made long excursions into the interior , and received a hearty welcome everywhere . confidence was at length so fully established that , in spite of crozet ' s representations , marion ordered the sloops ' boats to be disarmed . this was unpardonable imprudence in a country where tasman had given the name of assassin bay to the first point on which he landed , where cook had met with cannibals , and had been nearly massacred .
the account published by crozet contains very precise and circumstantial details regarding this island , with its productions and inhabitants . we will only <unk> from it one phrase , as <unk> as it is short .
after this trial , which had <unk> so much to his honour , <unk> obtained the rank and pension of an inspector of nautical watches .

the welcome accorded to la perouse was most cordial , in spite of the military force by which he had thought proper to protect himself . although the french were the first to land on <unk> island , la perouse did not think it his duty to take possession .
a bottle , containing an account of this deplorable accident , was buried at the foot of the monument .
the season was far advanced , and too short a time remained at la perouse ' s disposal to allow of his making detailed observations of these countries ; but his instinct had justly led him to imagine that the series of points he had discovered indicated a group of islands , and not a continent . beyond cape fleurien , which formed the extremity of an elevated island , he passed several groups , which he named <unk> , and then returning , he reached nootka sound on the 5 th of august . he afterwards visited various parts of the continent which cook had been unable to approach , and which had left a blank on his chart . this navigation was attended with a certain amount of danger , on account of the currents , " which rendered it impossible to make more than three knots an hour at a distance of five leagues from land . "
" we had just escaped one of the most imminent dangers to which navigators are subject , " says la perouse , " and i must do my crews the justice to say that less disorder and confusion in such a position would have been impossible . the slightest neglect in the execution of the manoeuvres which were necessary to carry us from the breakers would have been fatal . "
just as the french were <unk> , after leaving some presents for the natives , a pirogue landed seven natives , who showed no signs of fear .
" in another bay upon the same shore , called <unk> bay , the boats landed close to ten or twelve huts . they were larger than those we before had seen , and were divided into two rooms . that at the back contained the stove , cooking utensils , and the bench running all round . that in front was absolutely bare , and probably destined for the reception of strangers . the women fled when they saw the french land . two of them , however , were caught , and , whilst they were being <unk> , time was found to sketch them . their faces were peculiar , but pleasant ; they had small eyes and thick lips , the upper one being painted or tattooed . "
" m . de langle , " says the narrative , " was a man of so much judgment , that his representation influenced my decision more than anything else .
it may readily be supposed that an event which deprived la perouse of a large number of officers , and of thirty-two of his best sailors , was calculated to upset the plans of the expedition . at the slightest approach of danger it would now be necessary to destroy one frigate , in order to arm the other . but one course remained for la perouse - to set sail for botany bay , reconnoitring the various islands he passed , and taking their astronomical positions .
" i will mention one of their many manoeuvres . a man offered to sell me the little bag of stones which he carried at his waist . he unfastened it , and pretended to offer it to me in one hand , whilst he held out the other for the price upon which we had agreed . but at the same moment another native , who had taken up his stand behind me , uttered a shrill scream , which made me turn my head in his direction , whereupon the rogue made off with his bag , and hid himself in the crowd . we were unwilling to punish him , although most of us carried our guns .

the two ships at length reached d ' entrecasteaux strait , which had escaped the notice of tasman , furneaux , cook , marion , hunter and bligh , and the discovery of which was the result of a mistake , which might have had dangerous consequences . the vessels had anchored in this spot for the sake of obtaining water , and several boats were sent in search of it .
the entrance to port jackson is only two miles in width , but it widens until it forms a large harbour containing water enough for the largest ships , and space enough to accommodate all comers in perfect safety . a thousand ships of the line might easily anchor there , according to commodore <unk> ' report .
leaving this town upon the 0 th of january , 1700 , mungo park reached <unk> , the capital of kasson - a fertile , rich , and <unk> country , which can place forty thousand men under arms . the king , full of kindly feeling for the traveller , wished him to remain in his kingdom as long as the wars between kasson and <unk> lasted . it was more than probable that the countries of kaarta and bambara , which mungo park wished to visit , would be drawn into it . the advice of the king to remain was prudent , and park had soon reason enough to regret not having followed it .
" so , " says mungo park , " there can be little doubt of this fruit being the lotus mentioned by pliny as the food of the <unk> <unk> . i have tasted lotus bread , and think that an army may very easily have been fed with it , as is said by pliny to have been done in <unk> . the taste of the bread is so sweet and agreeable , that the soldiers would not be likely to complain of it . "
the results of this long campaign were important . le vaillant obtained some decided information about the <unk> , a numerous race which must not be confounded with the hottentots properly so called , but are probably the <unk> of their <unk> with the kaffirs . with regard to the hottentots themselves , the information collected by le vaillant agrees on almost every point with that obtained by sparrman .
" they appear taller even than the <unk> , although possibly they are not so in reality ; but the illusion is sustained by their small bones , delicate and emaciated appearance , and slender limbs . the long mantle of light material which hangs from the shoulder to the ground adds to their height . they look like drawn out men . lighter in colour than the cape natives , they have better features than the other hottentot tribes , owing to the fact that their noses are less flat and their cheek bones less prominent . "
we now come to the account of the expeditions undertaken in the east of africa , foremost amongst which is that of the well-known traveller bruce . a scotchman by birth , like so many other african explorers , james bruce was brought up for the bar ; but the sedentary nature of his occupation had little charm for him , and he embraced an opportunity of entering commercial life . his wife died a few years after their marriage , and bruce started for spain , where he employed his leisure in studying arabic monuments . he wished to publish a detailed account of those in the <unk> , but the spanish government refused him the necessary permission .
<unk> olivier , who traversed the greater portion of the western hemisphere , at the end of the last century , had a strange career . employed by <unk> de <unk> to translate a statistical paper on paris , he lost his patron and the payment for his labours in the first outburst of the revolution . wishing to employ his talent for natural history away from paris , he was nominated , by the minister roland , to a mission to the distant and little-known portions of the <unk> empire . a naturalist , named <unk> , was associated with him .
" scarcely any naturalist , " says humboldt in a letter to la <unk> , " who , like myself , has passed through to the indies , has had time to do more than go to the foot of this colossal volcano , and admire the delightful gardens of <unk> . fortunately for me our frigate , the pizarro , stopped for six days . i examined in detail the layers of which the peak of <unk> is composed . we slept in the moonlight at a height of 1200 fathoms . at two o ' clock in the morning we started for the summit , where we arrived at eight o ' clock , in spite of the violent wind , the great heat of the ground , which burnt our boots , and the intense cold of the atmosphere . i will tell you nothing about the magnificent view , which included the volcanic islands of <unk> , canaria , and gomera , at our feet ; the desert , twenty leagues square , strewn with pumice-stone and lava , and without insects or birds , separating us from thickets of <unk> and heaths ; or of the vineyards studded with palms , banana , and dragon-trees , the roots of which are washed by the waves . we went into the very crater itself . it is not more than forty or sixty feet deep . the summit is 1900 fathoms above the sea-level , as estimated by <unk> in a very careful <unk> measurement . . . . the crater of the peak - that is to say , of the summit - has been inactive for several centuries , lava flowing from the sides only . the crater , however , provides an enormous quantity of sulphur and sulphate of iron . "
" i have just completed an intensely interesting journey in the interior of paria , in the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . i had two or three mules loaded with instruments , dried plants , &c . we penetrated to the <unk> mission , which had never been visited by any naturalist . we discovered a great number of new plants , chiefly varieties of palms ; and we are about to start for the orinoco , and propose pushing on from it perhaps to san carlos on the rio negro , beyond the equator . we have dried more than 1600 plants , and described more than 500 birds , picked up numberless shells and insects , and i have made some fifty drawings . i think that is pretty well in four months , considering the <unk> heat of this zone . "
according to pottinger ' s account , the population is divided into two distinct classes - the belutchis and the <unk> , and each of these is <unk> into a number of tribes . the first is related to the modern persian , both in appearance and speech ; the <unk> , on the contrary , retains a great number of hindu words . <unk> between the two has given rise to a third .
upon the 1st of august the travellers left this place , hoping to reach lake <unk> , and leaving on the right lake <unk> , which is supposed to be the source of the largest branch of the <unk> .
the narrative describes the wind which comes from the snow-covered mountains of <unk> as cold and piercing , and the ascent of the mountain as long and painful , its descent slippery and steep , making precautions necessary . " we suffered greatly , " says the writer ; " our goats escaped by the negligence of their drivers , and climbed up to the edge of a precipice some hundred feet in height . a <unk> disturbing them from their perilous position , they began the descent , running down a very steep incline . the hinder ones kicked up the stones , which , falling with violence , threatened to strike the foremost . it was curious to note how cleverly they managed to run , and avoid the falling stones . "
klaproth , who was born at berlin on the 1 th october , 1700 , gave proof at a very early age of a special aptitude for the study of oriental languages . at fifteen years old he taught himself chinese ; and he had scarcely finished his studies at the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , when he began the publication of his " asiatic magazine . " invited to russia by count <unk> , he was at once named professor of oriental languages at the academy of st . petersburg .
" he wished to know , " says laing , " why he had been fired at , and was , with some difficulty , persuaded that it had been done out of honour to him . ' why did you point your guns to the ground ? ' ' that you might see our intention was to show you respect . ' ' but the pebbles flew in my face ; why did you not point in the air ? ' ' because we feared to burn the thatch on your houses . ' ' well , then , give me some rum . ' "
" <unk> , " to quote laing again , " the principal chief or king of this part of the timmannee country , is about ninety years of age , with a <unk> , <unk> skin , resembling in colour that of an alligator more than that of a human being , with dim , greenish eyes , far sunk in his head , and a <unk> , twisted beard , hanging down about two feet from his chin ; like the king of the opposite district he wore a necklace of coral and leopard ' s teeth , but his mantle was brown and dirty as his skin . his swollen legs , like those of an elephant , were to be observed from under his trousers of <unk> , which might have been originally white , but , from the wear of several years , had assumed a greenish appearance . "
outside ghât the caravan with which laing was travelling was attacked , some say by tuaricks , others by berber arabs , a tribe living near the niger .
on the 5 th october , the english found themselves opposite the mouth of a large river . it was the <unk> or <unk> . at its junction with the niger is an important town called <unk> <unk> . after a narrow escape from being swallowed up in a whirlpool and crushed against the rocks , lander having found a suitable spot showing signs of habitation , determined to land . that this place had been visited a little time previously , was proved by two burnt out fires with some broken <unk> , fragments of earthenware vessels , cocoa-nut shells , <unk> of <unk> , &c . , which the travellers picked up with some emotion , for they proved that the natives had had dealings with europeans . some women ran away out of a village which three of lander ' s men entered with a view to get the materials for a fire . the exhausted explorers were resting on mats when they were suddenly surrounded by a crowd of half-naked men armed with guns , bows and arrows , cutlasses , iron <unk> , and spears . the coolness and presence of mind of the brothers alone averted a struggle , the issue of which could not be dubious . " as we approached , " says lander , " we made all the signs and motions we could with our arms , to deter the chief and his people from firing on us . his quiver was dangling at his side , his bow was bent , and an arrow which was pointed at our breasts already trembled on the string , when we were within a few yards of his person . this was a highly critical moment , the next might be our last . but the hand of providence averted the blow ; for just as the chief was about to pull the fatal cord , a man that was nearest him rushed forward , and stayed his arm . at that instant we stood before him , and immediately held forth our hands ; all of them trembled like <unk> leaves ; the chief looked up full in our faces , kneeling on the ground ; light seemed to flash from his dark , rolling eyes , his body was convulsed all over , as though he were enduring the utmost torture , and with a timorous yet <unk> expression of countenance , in which all the passions of our nature were strangely blended , he drooped his head , eagerly grasped our proffered hands , and burst into tears . this was a sign of friendship ; harmony followed , and war and bloodshed were thought of no more . it was happy for us that our white faces and calm behaviour produced the effect it did on these people ; in another minute our bodies would have been as full of arrows as a <unk> ' s is full of <unk> . ' i thought you were children of heaven fallen from the skies , ' said the chief , in explanation of this sudden change . "
the two frenchmen had <unk> their discoveries by an excursion to the oasis of siwâh . at the end of 1800 they left <unk> with a few companions , and entered the <unk> desert . in fifteen days , and after a brush with the arabs , they reached siwâh , having on their way taken measurements of every part of the temple of jupiter ammon , and determined , as browne had done , its exact geographical position . a little later a military expedition was sent to this same oasis , in which <unk> collected new and very valuable documents <unk> those obtained by cailliaud and letorzec . they afterwards visited successively the oasis of <unk> , never before explored by a european , that of <unk> , and <unk> , the chief place of the <unk> oasis . the documents collected on this journey were sent to france , to the care of m . <unk> , who founded on them his work called " voyage à l ' oasis de <unk> . "
" there is that , " says desborough cooley in reference to <unk> ' s journey , " in the appearance of the himalaya range , which every person who has seen them will allow to be peculiarly their own . no other mountains that i have ever seen bear any resemblance to their character ; their summits shoot in the most fantastic and <unk> peaks to a height that astonishes , and , when viewed from an elevated situation , almost induce the belief of an ocular deception . "
the travellers landed at el <unk> on the red sea , and went with a small arab caravan to el <unk> , the ancient <unk> . the route they followed had never before been trodden by a european . it led through a wide , flat valley terminating at the dead sea ; a valley through which the waters of the dead sea were supposed at one time to have flowed towards the red sea . this hypothesis was shared by burckhardt and many others who had only seen the district from a distance , and who attributed the cessation of the <unk> to an upheaval of the soil . the heights , as taken by the travellers , showed this hypothesis to be altogether erroneous .
at the beginning of the nineteenth century , the russians for the first time took part in voyages round the world , until that time their explorations had been almost entirely confined to asia , and their only mariners of note were behring , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . the last-named took an important part in the voyage of the englishman <unk> , a voyage by the way which was far from achieving all that might have been fairly expected from the ten years it occupied and the vast sums it cost .
kotzebue had heard of this change , but he was not prepared to find european customs generally adopted .
on leaving <unk> , lütke made for ounalashka . <unk> is the chief trading establishment on that island , but it only contains some twelve russians and ten aleutians of both sexes .
lütke ' s instructions obliged him to explore st . matthew ' s island , which cook had called gore island . the hydrographical survey was successful beyond the highest expectations , but the russians could do nothing towards learning anything of the natural history of the island , for they were not allowed to land at all .

freycinet devotes a very long chapter in his narrative to all matters connected with political economy . the various <unk> and the crops suited to them ; industrial pursuits ; the breeding of cattle ; farming economy ; manufactures ; foreign trade ; means of communication ; government ; - all these subjects are treated <unk> on the authority of documents then newly <unk> , and with an ability that could scarcely have been expected from a man who had not given special attention to questions of this nature . he has , moreover , added a close inquiry into the regimen which the convicts were subjected to from the time of their arrival in the colony , the punishments they had to undergo , as also the encouragements and rewards which were readily granted to them , when earned by good behaviour . the chapter <unk> with reflections full of learning and sound judgment on the probable development and future prosperity of the australian colony .
the sailors , animated with fresh energy , rapidly pushed on the work . now was proved the sound judgment of the commander when <unk> the corvette at toulon , in selecting sailors who were also skilled in some mechanical employment . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all worked with zeal at the different tasks assigned to them .
the araucanians are of an ordinary stature , in complexion copper-coloured , with small , black , <unk> eyes , a rather flat nose , and thick lips ; the result of which is an expression of brutal ferocity . divided into tribes , each one jealous of another , all animated by an <unk> <unk> of plunder , and ever on the move , their lives are spent in perpetual warfare . the mounted <unk> is armed with a long lance , a long cutlass , <unk> , called a " <unk> , " [5] and the lasso , in the use of which they are extremely expert , while the horse he <unk> is usually swift .

nothing worthy of notice occurred on the voyage from macao to touron bay . arrived there , bougainville learned that the french agent , m . <unk> , had left <unk> for <unk> , with the intention of there <unk> a barque for singapore , and in the absence of the only person who could further his schemes he did not know with whom to open relations . fearing failure as an inevitable result of this <unk> he at once despatched a letter to <unk> , explaining the object of his mission , and expressing a wish to go with some of his officers to <unk> . the time which necessarily elapsed before an answer was received was turned to account by the french , who minutely surveyed the bay and its surroundings , together with the famous marble rocks , the objects of the curious interest of all travellers . touron bay has been described by various authors , notably by <unk> , as one of the most beautiful and vast in the universe ; but such is not the opinion of bougainville , who thinks these statements are to be taken with a great deal of <unk> . the village of touron is situated upon the sea-coast , at the entrance of the channel of <unk> , from the right bank of which rises a fort with <unk> , bastions , and a dry moat , built by french engineers .
vanikoro is surrounded by reefs , through which , not without danger , the astrolabe found a passage , casting anchor in the same place as dillon had done , namely in <unk> bay . the scene of the shipwreck was on the other side of the bay . it was not easy to get information from the natives , who were avaricious , <unk> , insolent , and deceitful . an old man , however , was finally induced to confess that the whites who had landed on the beach at <unk> had been received with a shower of arrows , and that a fight ensued in which a good many natives had fallen ; as for the <unk> ( sailors ) they had all been killed , and their skulls buried at <unk> . the rest of the bones had been used to tip the arrows of the natives .
the two vessels left england on the 7 th september , 1800 , touched at <unk> , one of the cape verd islands , and cast anchor in the following december in the port of st . helena , on the eastern coast of patagonia , where some valuable observations were taken on the position of that town .
as a reward for all he had done , and as an encouragement for the future , biscoe received medals both from the english and french geographical societies .
on the 2 th april ross reached kerguelen ' s island , and there landed his instruments . the scientific harvest was abundant . some fossil trees were extracted from the lava of which this island is formed , and some rich layers of coal were discovered , which have not yet been worked . the 9 th was fixed for simultaneous magnetic observations in different parts of the globe , and by a singular coincidence some magnetic storms such as had already visited europe , were on this very day observed in these latitudes . the instrument registered the same phenomena as at <unk> , canada , proving the vast extent of these meteoric disturbances , and the incredible rapidity with which they spread .

" why should sarah attend your religious rites ? "
one evening , instead of directing his steps toward the sea , the indian climbed over the high rocks on which the principal habitations of chorillos are built ; a house , <unk> by broad stone steps , struck his eyes - he entered it without noise .
without , a man was wandering in mortal anxiety ; it was the marquis don vegal .
then the sambo marched with hasty steps to the <unk> , and rejoined the chief of the revolt .
the room in which these two notable personages , charged with the government of quiquendone , were talking , was a parlour richly adorned with <unk> in dark wood . a lofty fireplace , in which an oak might have been burned or an ox roasted , occupied the whole of one of the sides of the room ; opposite to it was a <unk> window , the painted glass of which <unk> down the brightness of the sunbeams . in an antique frame above the <unk> appeared the portrait of some worthy man , attributed to <unk> , which no doubt represented an <unk> of the van <unk> , whose authentic <unk> dates back to the fourteenth century , the period when the flemings and <unk> de <unk> were engaged in wars with the emperor <unk> of <unk> .
" what , is it still burning ? "
" the commissary passauf ! "
" this doctor custos , " muttered van tricasse , " is decidedly a dangerous man - a <unk> fellow ! come , gentlemen ! "
the day after that on which commissary passauf had made his noisy entrance into the burgomaster ' s parlour , <unk> ygène and doctor ox were talking in the laboratory which both occupied in common , on the ground-floor of the principal building of the <unk> .
" nothing new , " answered niklausse .
" yes , counsellor ; but the words which passed were not of grave import . "

but one who lives under such conditions , breathing this gas which <unk> the body <unk> as well as the soul , dies speedily , like a madman .
the city of geneva lies at the west end of the lake of the same name . the rhone , which passes through the town at the outlet of the lake , divides it into two sections , and is itself divided in the centre of the city by an island placed in <unk> . a topographical feature like this is often found in the great <unk> of commerce and industry . no doubt the first inhabitants were influenced by the easy means of transport which the swift currents of the rivers offered them - those " roads which walk along of their own accord , " as pascal puts it . in the case of the rhone , it would be the road that ran along .
" do you think , " asked gerande simply , " that we might pray to god to give life to my father ' s watches ? "
" in faith , master , " returned aubert , " i don ' t like the night for either of us ! "
" indeed , master , " said he , " i love to see you work so unceasingly ! you will be ready for the festival of our <unk> , for i see that the work on this crystal watch is going forward <unk> . "
it was in the midst of this stagnation that master zacharius invented the escapement , which enabled him to obtain a mathematical regularity by submitting the movement of the pendulum to a sustained force . this invention had turned the old man ' s head . pride , swelling in his heart , like mercury in the thermometer , had attained the height of <unk> folly . by analogy he had allowed himself to be drawn to <unk> conclusions , and as he constructed his watches , he fancied that he had discovered the secrets of the union of the soul with the body .
meanwhile aubert carefully wound up the watch , but it would not go .

the hour of death .

" let us look at my father ' s book , " she replied .
" father ! " returned gerande , with so piteous an emotion that the old man seemed to return to the world of the living .
as they passed the chapel erected in memory of the massacre of the <unk> legion , they hurriedly crossed themselves . master zacharius was not to be seen .
" good-night , " said pittonaccio , and he disappeared .
at this moment clerbaut , an old <unk> , came in .
it was a curious sight to see this joyous group taking its way , at sunrise , towards the sea . the news of the ship ' s arrival had spread through the port , and many heads , in <unk> , appeared at the windows and at the <unk> doors . sincere compliments and pleasant nods came from every side .
" do you see your son , the captain ? " asked one .
the " jeune-hardie " was now entirely visible . already the crew were preparing to cast anchor . the upper sails had been reefed . the sailors who were among the rigging might be recognized . but neither marie nor jean cornbutte had yet been able to wave their hands at the captain of the ship .
chapter ii .
jean had a devoted sailor in penellan the breton , who had long been his <unk> . in times gone by , little marie was wont to pass the long winter evenings in the helmsman ' s arms , when he was on shore . he felt a <unk> friendship for her , and she had for him ah affection quite filial . penellan hastened the fitting out of the ship with all his energy , all the more because , according to his opinion , andré vasling had not perhaps made every effort possible to find the castaways , although he was excusable from the responsibility which weighed upon him as captain .
" the wife may well go in search of her husband , when the father <unk> to save his child . "
marie had not as yet comprehended andré ' s designs , for , to his great disgust , he could never find an opportunity to talk long with her alone . penellan had always an excuse for interfering , and destroying the effect of andre ' s words by the hopeful opinions he expressed .
" listen , captain . "
the house of snow .
jean cornbutte and marie came up beside the corpse , which was already stiffened by the ice . despair was written on every face . the dead man was one of the comrades of louis cornbutte !
" my son ! "
" my friends , " said penellan , " we will wait here until the cold decreases . have you provisions and wood ? "
about the 7 th of december , twenty days after the discovery of the castaways , they perceived the bay where the " jeune-hardie " was lying . what was their astonishment to see the brig perched four yards in the air on blocks of ice ! they hurried forward , much alarmed for their companions , and were received with joyous cries by gervique , turquiette , and gradlin . all of them were in good health , though they too had been subjected to formidable dangers .
but a bad piece of news spread gloom on the faces of jean cornbutte and his comrades . during the terrible gale the snow storehouse on the coast had been quite demolished ; the provisions which it contained were scattered , and it had not been possible to save a morsel of them . when jean and louis cornbutte learnt this , they visited the hold and steward ' s room , to ascertain the quantity of provisions which still remained .
at the beginning of the <unk> the basin had been upset on the stove , and the grease running over the burning coals , impregnated the atmosphere with its odour . marie rose with cries of despair , and hurried to the bed of old jean cornbutte .
from that day , louis cornbutte and his comrades passed through many other trials ; but the lemons , which they found , restored them to health .
it was useless to think of sleeping , much more of talking . we were absorbed by more or less gloomy thoughts . it was the night before the battle , with the difference that nothing forced us to engage in the struggle . two sorts of ideas struggled in the mind . it was the ebb and flow of the sea , each in its turn . objections to the venture were not wanting . why run so much danger ? if we succeeded , of what advantage would it be ? if an accident happened , how we should regret it ! then the imagination set to work ; all the mountain catastrophes rose in the fancy . i dreamed of snow bridges giving way under my feet , of being precipitated in the yawning crevasses , of hearing the terrible noises of the avalanches detaching themselves and burying me , of disappearing , of cold and death seizing upon me , and of struggling with desperate effort , but in vain !
we advanced towards this terrible wall ! m . n - - ' s party began to descend , and we heard <unk> talking rapidly to him . the inclination became so steep that we perceived neither him nor his guides , though we were bound together by the same rope .
we remained thus , suspended between life and death , for an hour , which seemed an eternity ; at last we reached the bottom of this terrible escarpment . we there found m . n - - and his party , safe and sound .
" not only did he tell me , but he showed him to me . "
on the 5 th of february , 1800 , this strange vessel was successfully launched in the sight of an immense number of spectators .
the commander gave him quarters on board , and sent a letter , with the news of his arrival , to leghorn .
the 5 th of april , the day of departure , came . the fact that the doctor had joined the expedition gave some comfort to those on board . wherever he could go they could follow . still , most of the sailors were very uneasy , and shandon , fearing that their number might be diminished by desertion , was very anxious to get to sea . the land once out of sight , the men would soon be resigned .
" if that letter , " said the mate , " doesn ' t tell me the captain ' s name , it must at least tell us whither we are bound . if not , in what direction shall we sail ? "
" now , commander , " resumed johnson , " i have one piece of advice to give you , and that is , to make everything ready for sailing . let the crew think you are certain of what you are about . to-morrow , whether a letter comes or not , set sail ; don ' t start your fires ; the wind promises to hold ; nothing will be easier than to get off ; take a pilot on board ; at the ebb of the tide leave the docks ; then anchor beyond birkenhead point ; the crew will have no more communication with the land ; and if this <unk> letter does come at last , it can find us there as well as anywhere . "
[illustration : " the news spread immediately throughout the city , and a great concourse of spectators thronged the piers . " ]
" but it ' s true ; so i have no need to be surprised , now that we are two degrees farther north , at our sighting an iceberg . "
soon more numerous flocks of birds , petrels , puffins , and others which inhabit those barren shores , gave token of their approach to greenland . the forward was moving rapidly northward , leaving behind her a long line of dark smoke .
" we must get through , doctor ; in june and july we should have found the passage free , as do the whalers ; but our orders were strict ; we had to be here in april . if i ' m not very much mistaken , our captain is a sound fellow with an idea firm in his head ; his only reason for leaving so early was to go far . whoever <unk> will see . "
numerous pieces of wood were drifting along , <unk> continually into one another ; a few whales with large heads approached the ship ; but they could not think of chasing them , although simpson , the harpooner , earnestly desired it . towards evening several seals were seen , which , with their noses just above the water , were swimming among the great pieces of ice .
" because i want to , " answered pen , brutally ; " and i don ' t care what any one says . "
[illustration]
shandon asked the names of the whalers which had last arrived ; he recognized none . he was in despair .
the 9 th of may the forward passed within a few cable-lengths of the <unk> of the baffin islands . the doctor noticed many rocks between the islands and the mainland which were what are called crimson cliffs ; they were covered with snow as red as <unk> , which dr . kane says is of purely vegetable origin ; clawbonny wanted to examine this singular phenomenon , but the ice forbade their approaching them ; although the temperature was rising , it was easy to see that the icebergs and ice-streams were accumulating toward the north of baffin ' s bay .
" a pleasant journey , captain ! " cried the brutal sailor .
now this was an american ship . grinnell was an american , kane was an american !
" and what are six hundred miles , " said the doctor , briskly , " when it is proved that a cossack , <unk> <unk> , went along the frozen sea , north of russia , on sledges drawn by dogs , for a distance of eight hundred miles , in twenty-four days ? "
" captain , " answered shandon , coldly , " i can only repeat what i have said , - i shall obey you . "
" put a triple charge in the forward gun , and ram it in as hard as possible ! "
" from 1800 to 1800 , " continued the doctor , with a gesture of agreement , " we find the prince albert making a second attempt with the french lieutenant , bellot ; he winters at <unk> bay in prince regent ' s sound , explores the southwest of somerset , and <unk> the coast as far as cape walker . meanwhile , the enterprise and investigator , having returned to england , came under the command of collinson and macclure , and they rejoined kellet and moore at behring strait ; while collinson returned to winter at <unk> , macclure went on , and after three winters , 1800-50 , 1800-50 , and 1800-50 , he discovered the northwest passage without finding any traces of franklin . from 1800 to 1800 , a new expedition , consisting of three sailing-vessels , the assistance , the resolute , the north star , and two <unk> , the pioneer and the intrepid , started out under the orders of sir edward belcher , with captain kellet second in command ; sir edward visited wellington channel , wintered in northumberland bay , and explored the coast , while kellet , pushing on as far as <unk> on melville island , explored that region without success . but then it was <unk> in england that two ships , abandoned in the ice , had been seen not far from new caledonia . at once lady franklin fitted out the little <unk> isabella , and captain inglefield , after ascending baffin ' s bay to victoria point , at the eightieth parallel , returned to beechey island with equal <unk> . at the beginning of 1800 the american grinnell <unk> the expense of a new expedition , and dr . kane , trying to reach the pole - "

" and he is probably right , dr . clawbonny ; if in england time is money , here it is safety , and for the delay of a day , of an hour even , the whole voyage might be rendered useless . we must let him do as he pleases . "
there was half a day of anxiety for all . but suddenly , at about two o ' clock , these words were shouted from aloft , -
the huge monster kept appearing above the waves , showing its black back , which resembled a great rock in the sea ; a whale never <unk> rapidly unless pursued , and this one was letting itself be rocked by the waves .
" lead the way , johnson , " said hatteras ; " do you remember it ? "
brunton walked toward the hatchway ; but he stopped before going down .
" not a word from any of you , " said hatteras , " or he ' s a dead man . "
at that moment johnson and bell disarmed pen , who no longer resisted , and suffered himself to be led to the bottom of the hold .

hatteras , not being able to get around this obstacle , determined to attack it boldly in front . he made use of his strongest blasting cylinders , containing eight or ten pounds of powder . the men would dig a hole in the <unk> part of the ice , close the orifice with snow , after having placed the cylinder in a horizontal position , so that a greater extent of ice might be exposed to the explosion ; then a fuse was lighted , which was protected by a gutta-percha tube .

" of course , " answered pen , " when the ship can ' t carry the crew , the ship ought to be burned . "
" hatteras , we are going to die from want of fire ! "
" that is your wish , captain ? "
in spite of the cold and fatigue , clawbonny remained for a long time in a <unk> , from which it was no easy task for his companions to arouse him ; but they had to think of resting ; the snow-hut was completed ; the four travellers crawled in like moles , and soon were all asleep .
" there ' s some one , " he said . " hatteras ! bell ! simpson ! is that you ? come , answer ! "
sometimes he felt the animal ' s breath , which was soon lost in the frost-rime ; again he would see the monster ' s huge paws beating the air so near him that his clothes were occasionally torn by its sharp claws ; he jumped back , and the animal disappeared like a <unk> spectre .
" dr . clawbonny ! "
" an american ! " said johnson , thoughtfully .

" you do not doubt our courage , " continued the doctor ; " we are willing to follow you to the last , you know very well ; but should we not now abandon all hope of reaching the pole ? mutiny has overthrown your plans ; you fought successfully against natural obstacles , but not against the weakness and perfidy of men ; you have done all that was humanly possible , and i am sure you would have succeeded ; but , in the present condition of affairs , are you not compelled to give up your project , and in order to take it up again , should you not try to reach england without delay ? "
" what do you hope for ? " answered johnson .
some one else , an american , had got three degrees nearer the pole ! and for what purpose ?
but altamont , who was listening to the conversation , gave the doctor to understand that he wished to speak . after an effort of about a quarter of an hour , clawbonny made out that the porpoise was lying on a bed of rocks , and so could not have drifted away . this information calmed the anxiety of the englishmen ; still it deprived them of their hope of returning to europe , unless bell should be able to build a small boat out of the timbers of the porpoise . however that might be , it was now of the utmost importance that they should reach the wreck .
such was the impression that this spectacle made on the doctor ' s mind , and he spoke of it to his companion .
" no , doctor ; if we ' ve got to come to it , why should we prolong the animal ' s sufferings ? he ' s hungry as we are ; he has no seal to eat ! heaven sends him us men ; well , so much the better for him ! "

" well , doctor , you are here , and i hope with your aid all will go well . "
" couldn ' t be better , " added altamont . " hurrah for dr . clawbonny ! "
" well , that light would not be bright enough , and it would be wrong to use up any of our fuel . "
" well , the materials are there , " answered the doctor , " and in an hour we shall have a column ten feet high , which will be enough . "
" dr . clawbonny , " he said , " has made another sun ! "
" you are right , " answered the doctor ; " and it is a remark which i have often made myself ; it is not only that plenty of food is needed , but also because it is often hard to get it . so one is always thinking of it and consequently always talking of it ! "
" come , push on , " said the doctor , " it ' s growing late ; to be sure , we ' ve had poor luck ; but as long as we have enough for supper , there ' s no need of complaining . only let ' s take the shortest way and try not to get lost ; the stars will help us . "
" i dare say , " said johnson ; " you know everything . "
" but what temperature has been reached above the arctic circle ? " asked altamont .
" ' wanted . a <unk> , respectable woman to help dress the ladies of the troupe of the " theatre royal of north georgia . " suitable salary given , tea and beer free . address the committee of the theatre . - n . b . a widow preferred . ' "
" had you , captain ? " asked johnson .
" it is your turn to speak , bell , " said hatteras .
" perhaps , " suggested bell , " we might build a launch out of the timbers of the porpoise . "
[illustration]
johnson had reached this point in his reflections , and the hunters had been gone an hour , when a loud report was heard two or three miles to windward .
" but if he were far off , " answered altamont , " and did not understand ? there are eight chances out of ten that he ' ll come back without suspicion of danger ! the bears are hiding behind the <unk> of the fort , and he can ' t see them . "
" doctor , " interrupted altamont , " can ' t the bears get through the <unk> you cut ? "
" and why so , pray ? "
" no , " said clawbonny , " let us talk frankly ; it ' s not the boat you mind , it ' s the man . "
" go on , doctor , " said johnson , " these gentlemen will listen , and you cannot fail to give us some information . "
" go on , doctor , " said the american .
" august 5 , 1800 , " continued the doctor , " after a final communication with the plover , macclure sailed eastward by an almost unknown route ; see how little land is marked upon the chart . august 0 th he rounded cape bathurst ; september 6 th he discovered baring land , which he afterwards discovered to form part of banks land , then prince albert ' s land . then he resolved to enter the long straits between these two large islands , and he called it prince of wales strait . you can follow his plan . he hoped to come out in melville sound , which we have just crossed , and with reason ; but the ice at the end of the strait formed an impassable barrier . there macclure wintered in 1800-50 , and meanwhile he pushed on over the ice , to make sure that the strait connected with the sound . "
[illustration : " a hard struggle with the icebergs . " ]

duke ran ahead , and soon came across some traces of a herd of musk-oxen ; he then advanced rapidly , and soon disappeared from the eyes of the hunters . they followed his clear barking , which soon grew so hasty that they knew he had discovered the object of their search . they pushed on , and in an hour and a half they came up to two of these animals ; they were large , and formidable in appearance . they appeared much surprised at duke ' s attacks , but not alarmed ; they were feeding off a sort of reddish moss which grew on the thin soil . the doctor recognized them at once from their moderate height , their horns , which were broad at the base , the absence of muzzle , their <unk> forehead , and short tail ; their shape has earned for them from naturalists the name of " <unk> , " a compound , and which expresses the two sorts of animals whose characteristics they share . thick , long hair and a sort of delicate brown silk formed their fur .
only four days were there before the time fixed for their departure . hatteras hurried on the last preparations ; he was in a hurry to leave new america , a land which was not his , and which he had not named ; he did not feel at home .
in a word , they had passed pleasant hours there . the doctor , at the evening meal , called up to his companions ' memory touching reminiscences , and he did not forget to thank heaven for its evident protection .

" but what shall we do for torches ? "
[illustration : " the launch was rocking gently in her little harbor . " ]
this enormous volcano , jutting up in mid-ocean , was about six thousand feet high , very nearly the altitude of hecla . a line from the summit to the base would form with the horizon an angle of about eleven degrees . it seemed to rise from the bosom of the waves as the launch approached it . there was no trace of vegetation . there was no shore ; it ran down steep to the sea .
still , it seemed unlikely that any corpse should rest there ; there was no beach , and the sea beat against the steep rocks ; thick ashes , on which no human foot had ever stepped , covered the ground beyond the reach of the waves . at last the launch slipped between the breakers , and there she was perfectly sheltered against the surf . then duke ' s lamentable howling redoubled ; the poor animal called for the captain with his sad <unk> among the rocks . his barking was vain ; and the doctor caressed him , without being able to calm him , when the faithful dog , as if he wanted to replace his master , made a prodigious leap , and was the first to get ashore amid the dust and ashes which flew about him .
" for that reason , johnson , i was going to give you two comparisons which you could remember . don ' t forget that it would take seventy-five moons to make the sun , and three hundred and fifty thousand <unk> to make up the weight of the sun . "
" it ' s a fiery crater ! "
when he came to himself , the doctor gave him a questioning glance in mute agony . but his vague look , like that of a blind man , made no reply .
the next day , saturday , july 3 th , the camping materials were put on the boat , and soon everything was ready for their departure . but before leaving this rock forever , the doctor , following hatteras ' s intentions , put up a cairn at the place where the captain reached the island ; this cairn was built of large rocks laid on one another , so as to form a perfectly visible landmark , if it were not destroyed by the eruption .
" you are right , doctor , but i am afraid the ice is not yet hard enough . "
altamont , who all along had shown great devotion and <unk> , took advantage of the strength he had left , and resolved to procure by hunting some food for his companions . he took his gun , called duke , and strode off for the plains to the north ; the doctor , johnson , and bell saw him go away without much interest . for an hour they did not once hear his gun , and they saw him returning without firing a single shot ; but he was running as if in great alarm .
this monkey , which is also known in brazil as the " <unk> , " was of large size . the suppleness and <unk> of his limbs proclaimed him a powerful creature , as fit to fight on the ground as to leap from branch to branch at the tops of the giants of the forest .
professor <unk> very properly protested against the pretended unhealthiness o the climate of a country which is destined to become one of the most active of the world ' s <unk> . according to him , " a soft and gentle breeze is constantly <unk> , and produces an evaporation , thanks to which the temperature is kept down , and the sun does not give out heat unchecked . the <unk> of this refreshing breeze renders the climate of the river amazon agreeable , and even delightful . "
but what has won the greatest honor for the brazilian government is that on the 30st of july , 1800 , after numerous frontier disputes between france and brazil , about the guiana boundary , the course of the amazon was declared to be free and open to all flags ; and , to make practice <unk> with theory , brazil entered into negotiations with the neighboring powers for the exploration of every <unk> in the basin of the amazon .
chapter vi . a forest on the ground
but though the means of transport devised by joam were primitive in the extreme , he was going to take with him a numerous following and abandon himself to the stream under exceptional conditions of comfort and security .
" you are wrong , " replied minha ; " that is not it , that is a liana of another kind . "
if a thicket barred the road the <unk> cut a deep gap , and the group passed in . if it was a high rock , carpeted with verdure , over which the liana twisted like a serpent , they climbed it and passed on .
but they had not proceeded for ten minutes along the interminable cipo , in the direction of the river , when they stopped , and this time not without cause .
the rise of the flood had clearly manifested itself for several days . from minute to minute the level of the river rose , and during the twenty-four hours which preceded the maximum the waters covered the bank on which the raft rested , but did not lift the raft .
" yes , manoel ; though i am of somewhat the same way of thinking as my brother . but even if we do not know their names , the islands of our great river are truly splendid ! see how they rest under the shadows of those gigantic palm-trees with their drooping leaves ! and the girdle of reeds which <unk> them through which a pirogue can with difficulty make its way ! and the <unk> trees , whose fantastic roots buttress them to the bank like the claws of some gigantic crab ! yes , the islands are beautiful , but , beautiful as they are , they cannot equal the one we have made our own ! "
the first day passed capitally ; breakfast , dinner , <unk> , walks , all took place as if joam garral and his people were still in the comfortable fazenda of iquitos .

" we are listening , " said minha .
" it was her duty to her husband , manoel , " said yaquita , " and i would have done the same . "
" i am always wrong ! " replied fragoso , and he hurried on to finish his task .
" how did you come from iquitos ? "
and at the same time he muttered to himself :
" very pleased to see you again , " said benito ; " but you have not forgotten that you promised to come to the fazenda to my father ? "
" i am happy , sir , to be able to oblige you , " replied joam .

" no , minha , i assure you . "
" if it pleases you to think so , " answered minha , " i do not envy any of them . "
but they had come to see . they walked through the streets , which contained more stalls than shops ; they strolled about the market-place , the rendezvous of the fashionable , who were nearly stifled in their european clothes ; they even breakfasted at an hotel - it was scarcely an inn - whose cookery caused them to deeply regret the excellent service on the raft .
after dinner , at which only turtle flesh , served up in different forms , appeared , the garral family went for the last time to admire the borders of the lake as the setting sun gilded it with its rays ; then they rejoined their pirogue , somewhat <unk> perhaps as to the magnificence of a town which one hour would give time enough to visit , and a little tired with walking about its stifling streets which were not nearly so pleasant as the shady <unk> of iquitos . the inquisitive lina ' s enthusiasm alone had not been <unk> .
this lake is one of the largest which communicates with the amazon , and it serves as a reservoir for different rivers . five or six affluents run into it , and there are stored and mixed up , and emerge by a narrow channel into the main stream .
the only thing that happened on this evening was the following :
" yes ; wait , before doing anything , but above all things let us be on our guard ! "
" well answered , padre ! " exclaimed manoel . " let us drink to the coming marriage of benito . "
" i do not know , " answered padre passanha , " unless torres - you are not married , i believe ? "
" you , doubtless ? " said benito very dryly .
torres stepped up to joam garral , who , with bowed head , seemed to be lost in thought , and putting his hand on his shoulder , said , " joam garral , may i have a few minutes ' conversation with you ? "
apparently joam garral expected anything from such a man , and was as quiet as before .
" dead ! " exclaimed joam garral ; and the word made him turn pale , in spite of himself , as if it had deprived him of all power of <unk> .
" the man ' s name ? " exclaimed joam garral , in a tone he could not control .
joam garral stopped himself . he regained his usual command over himself , and his features recovered their habitual calm .
" for the last time , joam garral , " he said , " i ask you for a last reply ! "
" mother , if you do not wish to kill her , " said manoel , " call me your son ! "
" the day when i confess everything , " joam repeated , " yaquita will pardon everything ! she will not doubt me for an instant ! but if i ought not to have deceived her , i certainly will not deceive the honest fellow who wishes to enter our family by marrying mina ! no ! i would rather give myself up and have done with this life ! "
" i was a fazender , and engaged in managing a farming establishment of considerable size . "
" at the least , sir , there was one thing that was not in my possession , and of the authenticity of which there can be no doubt . "
" before he was a judge in this province , " answered joam dacosta , " he was an advocate at villa rica . he it was who defended me in the trial at tijuco . he never doubted of the justice of my cause . he did all he could to save me . twenty years later , when he had become chief justice at manaos , i let him know who i was , where i was , and what i wished to attempt . his opinion about me had not changed , and it was at his advice i left the fazenda , and came in person to proceed with my rehabilitation . but death had unfortunately struck him , and maybe i shall be lost , sir , if in judge jarriquez i do not find another judge ribeiro . "
" what is it ? "
as soon as the young man saw himself face to face with torres , and was certain that he could not escape , a complete change took place in his manner , his coolness returned , and he became once more master of himself .
" really ! i should have thought an assassination would have better suited an assassin ' s son ! "

what a night it was for the passengers from the fazenda ! masters and servants had been affected by the blow ! were not the servants of the fazenda members of one family ? every one of them would watch over the safety of yaquita and her people ! on the bank of the rio negro there was a constant coming and going of the natives , evidently excited by the arrest of joam dacosta , and who could say to what excesses these <unk> men might be led ?
not an island , not an islet , checked the course of the amazon in these parts . hence , when the foot of the two banks had been visited up to the bar , it was in the bed itself , about five hundred feet in width , that more careful investigations had to be commenced .
on the other hand , when the man who falls into the water is already dead the conditions are different , and more favorable for his floating , for then the movements of which we have spoken are checked , and the liquid does not make its way to the lungs so copiously , as there is no attempt to <unk> , and he is consequently more likely to promptly reappear . manoel then was right in drawing the distinction between the man who falls into the water living and the man who falls into it dead . in the one case the return to the surface takes much longer than in the other .
benito , unable to resist the blows , <unk> upon the sand . his limbs were becoming paralyzed little by little under the electric influences of the gymnotus , which lightly touched his body as it wrapped him in its folds . his arms even he could not lift , and soon his spear escaped him , and his hand had not strength enough left to pull the cord and give the signal .
on the discovery of the document , jarriquez suddenly found himself face to face with the study of which he was a master . he , the <unk> after numerical combinations , the <unk> of amusing problems , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and such things , was at last in his true element .
" let us see , however , " he said , " if there is not some assemblage of letters which appears to form a word - i mean a <unk> word , whose number of consonants is in proportion to its vowels . and at the beginning i see the word <unk> ; further on the word gas . halloo ! <unk> . does that mean the african town on the banks of <unk> ? what has that got to do with all this ? further on here is the word <unk> . is it greek , then ? close by here is <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> . and before that we have got red and let . that is good ! those are two english words . then <unk> - <unk> ; then <unk> once more , and then the word <unk> . "
three hours had elapsed since he began . he had before his eyes an alphabet which , if his <unk> were right , would give him the right meaning of the letters in the document . he had only to successively apply the letters of his alphabet to those of his paragraph . but before making this application some slight emotion seized upon the judge . he fully experienced the intellectual gratification - much greater than , perhaps , would be thought - of the man who , after hours of obstinate endeavor , saw the impatiently <unk> sense of the <unk> coming into view .
and now he had done .
" tell me a number . "
" give me an example and you will understand the explanation better . "
judge jarriquez had run to the table , and , pencil in hand , had made out a formula with the number given by bobo , and which bobo had in this way only given him at a venture .
so reasoned fragoso . it was evident that his enterprise would do no good . but the thought of it was too much for him . an irresistible influence impelled him to set out , although he was not even sure of finding the band on the madeira . in fact , it might be engaged in some other part of the province , and to come up with it might require more time than fragoso had at his disposal ! and what would be the result ?
chapter xvii . the last night
he hardly knew . but in any case he was in great haste to acquaint judge jarriquez with what he had ascertained during his short excursion .
and so , if the document could be read , if the key had been found , if the cipher on which the system hung were known , no doubt of its truth could be entertained .


then there opened out the mouth of the rio <unk> , bathing with its black waters the houses of <unk> , situated at about one hundred and eighty miles from belem , quite a small town , and even a " <unk> " with large streets bordered with handsome habitations , and a great center for cocoa produce . then they saw another tributary , the <unk> , with its <unk> waters descending from the south-west ; and then <unk> , a wealthy town of not less than five thousand inhabitants , indians for the most part , whose nearest houses were built on the vast beach of white sand .
hundreds of craft of all sorts conveyed them to the fazender , and soon the jangada was invaded by all those who wished to welcome the return of their compatriot after his long exile . thousands of <unk> - or more correctly speaking , thousands of friends crowded on to the floating village as soon as it came to its moorings , and it was vast and solid enough to support the entire population . among those who hurried on board one of the first pirogues had brought madame valdez . manoel ' s mother was at last able to clasp to her arms the daughter whom her son had chosen . if the good lady had not been able to come to iquitos , was it not as though a portion of the fazenda , with her new family , had come down the amazon to her ?
" in short , " responded the reporter , " there are only malays who frequent these seas , and those fellows are ruffians which it is best to avoid . "
" i have an idea , mr . spilett , " said herbert . " if i were to climb to the top of one of these kauris , i could survey the country for an immense distance round . "
" yes , captain . "

" but what ' s in this chest ? " cried pencroft , with very natural impatience . " what ' s in this chest ? it is shut up , and nothing to open it with ! well , perhaps a stone - "
after this sudden angle the river widened and flowed under the shade of great evergreen firs .
" evidently . "
" what is it ? " asked spilett
but it was necessary to bring down the remains of the balloon from the tree , to place it in security , and this was no slight task . neb , herbert , and the sailor , climbing to the summit of the tree , used all their skill to disengage the now reduced balloon .
" we shall see , pencroft , " replied cyrus harding ; " we shall see . "
cyrus harding stood still , without saying a word . his companions searched in the darkness on the wall , in case the wind should have moved the ladder , and on the ground , thinking that it might have fallen down . . . . but the ladder had quite disappeared . as to ascertaining if a squall had blown it on to the landing-place , half way up , that was impossible in the dark .
so saying , the sailor , raising his piece , took a rapid aim at one of the monkeys and fired . all disappeared , except one who fell mortally wounded on the beach . this monkey , which was of a large size , evidently belonged to the first order of the quadrumana . whether this was a <unk> , an <unk> , or a gorilla , he took rank among the anthropoid apes , who are so called from their resemblance to the human race . however , herbert declared it to be an <unk> .
" and i hope he will make an excellent servant , " added herbert . " he appears young , and will be easy to educate , and we shall not be obliged to use force to subdue him , nor draw his teeth , as is sometimes done . he will soon grow fond of his masters if they are kind to him . "
cyrus harding still recommended them to husband the ammunition , and he took measures to replace the powder and shot which had been found in the box , and which he wished to reserve for the future . how did he know where chance might one day cast his companions and himself in the event of their leaving their domain ? they should , then , prepare for the unknown future by <unk> their ammunition and by substituting for it some easily <unk> substance .
the tool , the manufacture of which presented the most difficulty , was the pipe of the glass maker , an iron tube , five or six feet long , which collects on one end the material in a state of fusion . but by means of a long , thin piece of iron rolled up like the barrel of a gun , pencroft succeeded in making a tube soon ready for use .
" and who made this discovery ? " he asked at length . " you , herbert , no doubt ? "
" pencroft , " replied the engineer , placing his hand on the sailor ' s shoulder , " if any misfortune happens to you , or to this lad , whom chance has made our child , do you think we could ever cease to blame ourselves ? "
" for at least two hundred and fifty or three hundred years . "
" water ! " cried pencroft , " water as fuel for steamers and engines ! water to heat water ! "
when the settlers , leaning from their windows , gazed on the huge watery masses breaking beneath their eyes , they could not but admire the magnificent spectacle of the ocean in its impotent fury . the waves <unk> in dazzling foam , the beach entirely disappearing under the raging flood , and the cliff appearing to emerge from the sea itself , the spray rising to a height of more than a hundred feet .
the sides were everywhere entire ; but points of rock jutted out here and there , and by means of these points it would have been quite possible for an active creature to climb to the mouth of the well .
the engineer remarked this ; but although he carefully examined these points by the light of his lantern , he could find no impression , no fracture which could give any reason to suppose that they had either recently or at any former time been used as a staircase . cyrus harding descended deeper , throwing the light of his lantern on all sides .
jup , carried by neb and pencroft , was placed in the lift , and only a slight moan now and then escaped his lips . he was gently drawn up to granite house . there he was laid on a mattress taken from one of the beds , and his wounds were bathed with the greatest care . it did not appear that any vital part had been reached , but jup was very weak from loss of blood , and a high fever soon set in after his wounds had been dressed . he was laid down , strict diet was imposed , " just like a real person , " as neb said , and they made him swallow several cups of a cooling drink , for which the <unk> were supplied from the vegetable medicine chest of granite house . jup was at first restless , but his breathing gradually became more regular , and he was left sleeping quietly . from time to time top , walking on <unk> , as one might say , came to visit his friend , and seemed to approve of all the care that had been taken of him . one of jup ' s hands hung over the side of his bed , and top licked it with a <unk> air .
the evening was occupied in transporting on board the bonadventure articles of bedding , utensils , arms , ammunition , a compass , provisions for a week , and this business being rapidly accomplished the colonists ascended to granite house .
the bonadventure behaved capitally . bounding over the waves she proceeded rapidly on her course . pencroft had hoisted the foresail , and steering by the compass followed a rectilinear direction . from time to time herbert relieved him at the helm , and the lad ' s hand was so firm that the sailor had not a point to find fault with .
and yet the document was clear enough ; there was a castaway , and this castaway should have been on the watch .
" yes , " replied gideon spilett , " but the unfortunate man has no longer anything human about him ! "
" there is some painful mystery there ! " said harding .
" my friend ! " said he .
the colony was rich in corn , for ten bushels alone were sufficient for sowing every year to produce an ample crop for the food both of men and beasts . the harvest was completed , and the last fortnight of the month of november was devoted to the work of converting it into food for man . in fact , they had corn , but not flour , and the establishment of a mill was necessary . cyrus harding could have <unk> the second fall which flowed into the mercy to establish his motive power , the first being already occupied with moving the <unk> mill ; but after some consultation , it was decided that a simple windmill should be built on prospect heights . the building of this presented no more difficulty than the building of the former , and it was moreover certain that there would be no want of wind on the plateau , exposed as it was to the sea breezes .
" ayrton was alone , but he had no want of either ammunition , weapons , tools , or seeds .
" well ! " answered pencroft , " i agree with you that the nobleman will return , and soon too . but where will he touch ? at tabor island , and not at lincoln island . "
" and why should we have done it ? " asked herbert .
on the morning of the 6 th of april all the colonists , including top , embarked . a fine breeze blew from the south-west , and the bonadventure tacked on leaving port balloon so as to reach reptile end . of the ninety miles which the perimeter of the island measured , twenty included the south coast between the port and the promontory . the wind being right ahead , it was necessary to <unk> the shore .
" don ' t make your mind uneasy , captain , " replied the sailor , " i shall not expose myself needlessly ! i would rather a knife were run into my ribs than a sharp rock into those of my bonadventure ! "
" why , captain , " cried herbert , " that fire was blazing like a star of the first magnitude ! "
hence in every country of the world - empire , kingdom , or republic - there was anxiety which it was important to allay . if you hear in your house strange and inexplicable noises , do you not at once endeavor to discover the cause ? and if your search is in vain , do you not leave your house and take up your quarters in another ? but in this case the house was the terrestrial globe ! there are no means of leaving that house for the moon or mars , or venus , or jupiter , or any other planet of the solar system . and so of necessity we have to find out what it is that takes place , not in the infinite void , but within the <unk> zones . in fact , if there is no air there is no noise , and as there was a noise - that famous trumpet , to wit - the phenomenon must occur in the air , the density of which invariably diminishes , and which does not extend for more than six miles round our spheroid .
on two boards of perfect whiteness a black line is traced . the length of each of these lines is mathematically the same , for they have been determined with as much accuracy as the base of the first triangle in a trigonometrical survey . that done , the two boards were erected on the same day in the center of the conference room , and the two candidates , each armed with a fine needle , marched towards the board that had fallen to his lot . the man who planted his needle nearest the center of the line would be proclaimed president of the weldon institute .

strange as it was that at this affirmation the members of the weldon institute did not move . had they become as deaf as they were patient ? or were they reserving themselves to see how far this audacious contradictor would dare to go ?
" and the mosquito , which gives millions - "
" but i may remind you , all the same , that the theory of aviation is condemned beforehand , and rejected by the majority of american and foreign engineers . it is a system which was the cause of the death of the flying <unk> at constantinople , of the monk <unk> at lisbon , of de <unk> in 1800 , of de <unk> in 1800 , besides the victims i forget since the mythological icarus - "
" mr . <unk> , " he said " you who talk so much of the benefits of aviation , have you ever <unk> ? "
" decidedly , " said he , " it was not <unk> that discovered the new world , it was cabot ! you are not americans , citizen balloonists ! you are only <unk> - "
" what ? not any trees ? "

nothing , in fact , is better established , by experiment and calculation , than that the air is highly <unk> . a circumference of only a yard in diameter in the shape of a <unk> can not only impede descent in air , but can render it <unk> . that is a fact .

" be calm ! "
" shall we see mr . robur to-day ? " asked phil evans .
" just so . "
is the domain of the southern pole a continent or an archipelago ? or is it a <unk> sea , whose ice <unk> not even during the long summer ? we know not . but what we do know is that the southern pole is colder than the northern one - a phenomenon due to the position of the earth in its orbit during winter in the antarctic regions .
" no . wait till <unk> . when the night comes we will go into our cabin , and you shall see something that will surprise you . "
" we shall sacrifice ours as well ! " said uncle prudent . but it is doubtful if frycollin would have thought the reason sufficient .
uncle prudent was close to frycollin ' s cabin when phil evans stopped him . " the look-out ! " he said .
" nobody ! where can he be ? " asked phil evans .
it was then twenty minutes after midnight . five or six shots had been fired from the aeronef . uncle prudent and frycollin , supporting phil evans , had taken shelter among the rocks . they had not been hit . for the moment there was nothing to fear .
and then uncle prudent , resuming his speech amid a silence up to then unknown in the meetings of the weldon institute , said , " gentlemen , it now only remains for us to finish the aerostat ' go-ahead . ' it is left to her to effect the conquest of the air ! the meeting is at an end ! "
on this 9 th of april everything was ready . since eleven o ' clock the enormous aerostat had been floating a few feet from the ground ready to rise in mid-air . it was splendid weather and seemed to have been made specially for the experiment , although if the breeze had been stronger the results might have been more conclusive . there had never been any doubt that a balloon could be guided in a calm atmosphere ; but to guide it when the atmosphere is in motion is quite another thing ; and it is under such circumstances that the experiment should be tried .
it was indeed the " albatross ! " it was indeed robur who had reappeared in the heights of the sky ! it was he who like a huge bird of prey was going to strike the " go-ahead . "
into morganton sped the news that stones , lava , ashes , were raining down upon the country .

" i will act as seems best , mr . ward . "
" and in the midst of this noise , mr . smith , did you believe that you heard that most remarkable of all the phenomena , a sound like the flapping of great wings ? "
harry horn said to his comrade , " it will not be easy . "
" even money on the <unk> ! "
there was but one conclusion to be drawn . if the mysterious chauffeur had disappeared , if he had perished with his machine in lake michigan , it was equally important now to win the secret of this no less mysterious navigator . and it must be won before he in his turn plunged into the abyss of the ocean . was it not the interest of the inventor to disclose his invention ? would not the american government or any other give him any price he chose to ask ?
the envelope was sealed with red <unk> wax , and stamped with a sort of coat of arms , surmounted with three stars . the paper was thick and very strong . i broke the envelope and drew out a letter . it was a single sheet , folded in four , and written on one side only . my first glance was for the signature .
you sought a breech and you found none . know this : none enter the great eyrie ; or if one enters , he never returns .
" well , " returned my superstitious <unk> , " if it isn ' t from the devil , it ' s from the devil ' s country , anyway . "
then , on the <unk> of june , there came a new event , to further stimulate both my interest and that of the general public in the previous mysteries of the automobile and the boat . the washington evening star published the following account , which was next morning copied by every paper in the country .
" that the great eyrie was the spot selected by the inventor , where he gathered his material . "
" unless the machine of this master of the world has also wings , which permit it to take refuge in the great eyrie . "
posted there , at the mouth of the creek , wells and i exchanged scarcely a word . what need was there of words to enable us to understand each other ! after our eagerness and our despair , we were now exhausted . defeated in our <unk> attempt , we felt as unwilling to abandon our campaign , as we were unable to continue it .
we vaguely distinguished a black mass moving through the darkness . it advanced very slowly and was still outside the creek , upon the lake , perhaps a cable ' s length to the northeast . we could scarcely hear even now the faint throbbing of its engines . perhaps they had stopped and the boat was only gliding forward under their previous impulse .

it only remained for me to study this craft , from which we had been repelled with revolver shots , when we had seized upon its anchor rope .
he repelled me without violence , but with a movement that suggested tremendous restrained power .
" of that world to which i have already proved myself to be the most powerful of men . "
then the " albatross " rose under the impulse of its mighty screws , and sped away amidst the hurrahs of the multitude .

sometimes i saw him wander about the eyrie buried in thought , or he would stop and raise his arm toward heaven as if in defiance of that god with whom he assumed to divide the empire of the world . was not his <unk> pride leading him toward insanity ? an insanity which his two companions , hardly less excited than he , could do nothing to subdue ! had he not come to regard himself as <unk> than the elements which he had so <unk> defied even when he possessed only an airship , the " albatross ? " and now , how much more powerful had he become , when earth , air and water combined to offer him an infinite field where none might follow him !

" and do you know that language ? " asked glenarvan .
" we cannot have everything , my dear major , " replied glenarvan ; " and an exact degree of latitude is something . this french document is decidedly the most complete of the three . each of them was evidently a <unk> translation of the others , for they all convey the same information . we must , therefore , unite and translate them into one language , and seek their most probable meaning , the one that is most logical and <unk> . "
" in english , " answered glenarvan , " since that is our own language . "
" we do not need to go so far , " replied the captain ; " i have here the shipping news of the mercantile and shipping gazette , which will give us definite information . "
miss helena did not belong to a noble family , but she was scotch , which equaled all <unk> in the eyes of lord glenarvan . this charming young creature , <unk> and devoted , the lord of luss had made the companion of his life . he found her one day living alone , an orphan , almost without fortune , in the house of her father at <unk> . he saw that the poor girl would make a noble wife , and he married her .
" no , madam , " replied the steward , " for i do not know them . they have just arrived by the <unk> railway , and from <unk> to luss they tell me they have made the journey on foot . "
" the wife of lord glenarvan , of malcolm castle , who published an advertisement in the times in regard to the shipwreck of the britannia ? "
during this conversation , lady helena had not spoken of the fears expressed in her husband ' s letters concerning the reception of his petition by the london officials ; nor was a word said in regard to the probable captivity of captain grant among the indians of south america . why <unk> these poor children with their father ' s situation , and check the hopes they had just conceived ? it would not change matters . lady helena was , therefore , silent on this point , and , after satisfying all miss grant ' s inquiries , she questioned her concerning her life , and situation in the world in which she seemed to be the sole <unk> of her brother . it was a simple and touching story , which still more increased lady glenarvan ' s sympathy for the young girl .
" oh , <unk> ! my dear <unk> ! "

" that is for the captain to answer , " said he . " are we progressing well ? are you satisfied with your vessel , captain ? "

" yes , my lord . to see india is an idea that i have cherished all my life . it is my brightest dream , which shall be realized at last in the country of the elephants and the <unk> . "
" give it up ! and why ? "
" it is impossible , madam ; i must fulfil my mission . i shall disembark at your first landing . "
" my dear lord , " replied paganel , " i will not be formal with you . before my arrival on board , did you intend to stop at madeira ? "
" well , permit me to profit by the consequences of my unlucky blunder . madeira is an island too well known . everything has been said and written about it ; and it is , moreover , rapidly declining in point of civilization . if , then , it is all the same to you , let us land at the canaries . "
" as you please , my dear paganel , " replied glenarvan , who could not help smiling , and with good reason .
" i see nothing . "
" it appears to be of very moderate height . "
" yet it is eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea . "
" oh ! climb it , my dear captain ? what is the use , i ask you , after humboldt and bonpland ? what can i do after these great men ? "

" let us go to the custom-house , " replied glenarvan .
" my friends , god help you ! "
at five o ' clock in the morning the travelers had attained a height of seven thousand five hundred feet . they were now on the lower ridges , the last limit of arborescent vegetation . at this hour the aspect of these regions was entirely changed . great blocks of glittering ice , of a bluish color in certain parts , rose on all sides , and reflected the first rays of the sun .
" my glasses , to be sure ! "
[sidenote : " a dish for the gods . " ]
to this question no answer was given .
" that is going nowhere . "
" no . "
the lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour . at last paganel ceased , wiped his face , which was wet with perspiration , and looked at the patagonian .
" may his will be accomplished then ! " replied thalcave , with a certain solemnity . " we will go to the east , and , if necessary , even to the sun . "
" es <unk> padre , " answered the geographer .
the boy answered nothing .
" yes , my boy , and with our knives if we can no longer use our guns . "
" he ? never ! " said robert .
" no , " said glenarvan , " he will not leave us . "
" i will go . "
then it was the indian ' s turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son of captain grant .

<unk> , hearing himself complimented , joined his two little feet , and presented arms with perfect precision .
but this event disconcerted glenarvan ' s hopes . if captain grant was a prisoner of the caziques , he must have been carried by them to the northern frontiers . yet how and where to find him ? must they attempt a perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the pampas ? it was a serious matter , which was to be earnestly considered .
" i , " replied the major .
" ah , macnabb , " cried glenarvan , " this is just like you ! you think of everything , even under circumstances where it is allowable to forget . "
" of thalcave . he thought it might be useful to us , and gave it to me before going back to thaouka . "
" entirely , " answered tom austin , while wilson and mulready nodded assent .
" let us ask him , then , " said the major .
" yes , yes , monsieur paganel , " cried robert .
jacques paganel ' s story had a very great success . he was greatly applauded , but each retained his own opinion , and the geographer obtained the result common to most discussions , - of convincing nobody . however , they were agreed on this point , that it was necessary to have courage for every fortune , and be contented with a tree when one has neither palace nor cottage .
[sidenote : philosophy and ponchos . ]
while the geographer was <unk> thus , the whole eastern horizon assumed a stormy aspect . a dense and dark band , clearly defined , gradually rose , <unk> the light of the stars . this cloud of threatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky . its motive power must have been <unk> in itself , for there was not a breath of wind . not a leaf stirred on the tree , not a ripple curled the surface of the waters . even the air seemed to fail , as if some huge <unk> machine had rarefied it . a strong electric current was perceptible in the atmosphere , and every creature felt it course along the nerves . glenarvan , paganel , and robert were sensibly affected by these electric currents .
at last their situation was no longer tenable , and of two deaths they were forced to choose the least cruel .
" yes , the ocean ! " replied thalcave .
" we shall see her to-morrow , " replied macnabb .
" glenarvan . come , i need your eyes . "
glenarvan now joined thalcave , who , standing with folded arms alongside of thaouka , was calmly gazing at the waves .
" because i not only know spanish , but portuguese also . i speak two languages instead of one . "
" nevertheless , i am sorry , " replied the geographer .
" one more remark , " said the major .
" exactly so , " replied the captain .
" impossible ! " replied the major .
chapter xxix .
finally he went in search of lord glenarvan , consulted with him in private , explained their actual situation , viewed it with the coolness of a sailor who is ready for any emergency , and ended by saying that he should be obliged perhaps to run the duncan ashore .
in a few seconds the yacht reached the entrance to the pass , which was barred by a terrible line of foam .
" who says that ? "
" you see , then , my lord , " added ayrton , " that i was right in saying that , if captain grant still lives , you must seek him in australia . "
" my lord , i will answer for it that ayrton is an honest man . during the two months that he has been in my employ , i have had no fault to find with him . i knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity . he is a true man , and worthy of your entire confidence . "
" and you , mr . ayrton , " said lady helena , at length , to the quartermaster , " what would you do ? "
" one question , my lord . "
" very well , my lord , " said ayrton ; " rely on me . "
having made his arrangements , and given his orders to the carpenter , captain mangles returned on board with the colonist ' s family , who wished to pay lord glenarvan a visit . ayrton thought proper to join them , and about four o ' clock the captain crossed the gangway of the duncan .
glenarvan read aloud the following passage :
paganel , who was in his element wherever statistics or history was concerned , went into full details respecting the native races . he gave a long account of the <unk> to which these unfortunate beings had been subjected at the hands of the early colonists , and showed how little had been done by the interference of the government . as a striking instance of the manner in which the aborigines melt away before the advance of civilization , he cited the case of tasmania , which at the beginning of this century had five thousand native inhabitants , but in 1800 had only seven .

lord glenarvan was not satisfied with merely admiring the fairy wonders of this oasis of the australian desert . he listened with profound interest to the young men ' s story . in england , in the heart of civilization , a <unk> would have first informed his host whence he came and whither he was going ; but here , by a nice shade of distinction , michael and sandy patterson thought they should make themselves known to the travelers to whom they offered their <unk> , and briefly told their story .
" by my faith , " the major could not help exclaiming , " it is a pity , ayrton , that you did not shoe all our animals on crossing the wimerra . "
" very well , ayrton , " replied glenarvan ; " your idea deserves to be seriously considered . its greatest objection is the delay it will cause ; but it <unk> us severe hardships , and perhaps real dangers . what do you think , friends ? "
the quartermaster made his preparations for departure , aided by the two sailors , one of whom attended to his horse , and the other to his provisions . meantime glenarvan wrote the letter designed for tom austin .
[sidenote : another distraction . ]
" yes , " replied macnabb . " was it a man or an animal ? "

the captain and the sailor tried the canoe . all that skill , strength , or courage could do they did . but scarcely were they in the current , when they capsized and narrowly escaped with their lives . the boat was drawn into the eddies and disappeared . captain mangles and wilson had not advanced ten yards into the river , which was swollen by the rains and melting snows till it was now a mile in breadth .
" the wretches ! " cried glenarvan . " if they ever fall into my hands , i will avenge my crew ! "
" you are joyful and despairing at the same time ? "
and then he told them of its first discovery by abel tasman , the dutch navigator , in 1600 ; that , when first he landed , there seemed to be amicable feelings expressed by the islanders toward himself , a number of them coming back to his ship , and being apparently well pleased to cultivate intercourse . but on the next day , as he sent his boat to find good anchorage nearer to the shore , seven canoes of the islanders attacked it most violently and suddenly , causing it to capsize , and so vigorously <unk> its occupants with their pikes that it was with difficulty any of them were able to swim back to their ship , leaving those of their companions who were not drowned to be <unk> by the natives .
" to the <unk> ! let loose the sails ! " cried the young captain , managing so as to escape the reefs .
vain efforts .
" helena ! mary ! " cried glenarvan .
" to-morrow morning at ten o ' clock , " replied captain mangles . " the tide will begin to rise then , and will carry us ashore . "
olbinett took out of a case of provisions some pieces of dried meat and a dozen biscuits , though reluctant to offer such meagre fare . it was accepted , however , with good grace , even by the ladies , whose appetites the fresh sea air greatly improved .
two hours after , the first shadows of evening began to descend the mountains . the sun before disappearing below the western horizon had <unk> a few rays through a rift in the clouds . the eastern peaks were <unk> with the last beams of day .
" yes . the maoris do not search their female prisoners ; but this weapon is for us , edward , not for them . "
" my companions are also english . we are shipwrecked travelers , and , if you care to know , we have taken no part in the war . "
six unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and mistress . they were servants , whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced to slavery . during the life of the chief they had undergone the severest privations , suffered a thousand <unk> , had been <unk> fed , and compelled constantly to labor like beasts ; and now , according to the maori belief , they were to continue their existence of servitude for eternity .
the captives redoubled their efforts . their lacerated fingers bled , but still they dug on . after half an hour ' s labor , the hole they were <unk> had reached a depth of three feet . they could perceive by the sounds , which were now more distinct , that only a thin layer of earth prevented immediate communication .
glenarvan and lady helena now ventured out of the grotto . the darkness below was still profound , but the gray light of dawn was already <unk> the top of the mountain . the keen cold of the morning reanimated the young wife ; she felt stronger , and commenced her perilous escape .
but the fugitives could not doubt that their escape had been discovered . could they elude the pursuit of the natives ? had they been perceived ? would their tracks betray them ?
[sidenote : a scene of enchantment . ]
glenarvan cast an anxious glance around him . the mist had dissolved under the rays of the sun , and his eye could clearly distinguish the least depressions of the earth . no movement of the maoris could escape his sight .
and all saw , indeed , that an inexplicable change had taken place in the movements of the maoris . their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted . their ascent of the mountain had ceased , as if by an imperious interdict . the crowd of natives had checked their swiftness , and halted , like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock .
" but can they not - - ? "
" this plan is really well conceived , " remarked glenarvan . " there is only one chance against it , and that is , that the savages may persist in remaining at the foot of the mountain till the provisions fail us . but this is scarcely probable , especially if we play our part skillfully . "
paganel ' s plan was therefore adopted , and really , with the superstitious notions of the maoris , it might and ought to succeed . it only remained to execute it . the idea was good , but in practice difficult . might not this volcano consume the audacious ones who should dig the crater ? could they control and direct this eruption when the vapors , flames , and lava should be let loose ? would it not <unk> the entire peak in a flood of fire ? they were <unk> with those phenomena whose absolute control is reserved for forces higher than theirs .
" yes , " said he , " a ship , a steamer , under full headway , coming towards us ! courage , captain ! "
" read it , my lord , " said the old sailor .
" what do you wish , then ? "
as we have remarked , the geographer , although so loquacious and excitable usually , had scarcely spoken during ayrton ' s examination . he had listened in total silence . but this last word that he had uttered was worth more than all the others , and startled glenarvan at once .
a cry in the night .
" evidently , by savages , " replied paganel .
mary pressed her brother to her heart , and the child felt tears dropping upon his forehead .
" my father , my father is yonder ! "
" poor orphans ! " said captain mangles ; " god tries them in a terrible way ! "
" ' here , ' " resumed harry grant , " ' continually a prey to a cruel destitution , they cast this document into the sea at longitude 100° and latitude 30° 10 ' . come to their aid , or they are lost . ' "
" it seems so , captain . "
" i am unworthy of her ! " was the geographer ' s invariable reply .
" is that your opinion ? "
" meanwhile , " replied j . t . maston , " allow me to say that , if i cannot get an opportunity to try my new mortars on a real field of battle , i shall say good-by to the members of the gun club , and go and bury myself in the prairies of arkansas ! "

" i give it up , " answered the major . " you have such a way of <unk> things . and what <unk> do you expect to obtain in this way ? "
" it would be a superb idea , though , " said maston .
" cast iron is very brittle , though , " replied morgan .
it was finally agreed , then , that the columbiad must be cast on the soil of either texas or florida . the result , however , of this decision was to create a rivalry entirely without precedent between the different towns of these two states .
" yes ! " returned the tribune ; " after having been spaniards or english for two hundred years , you were sold to the united states for five million dollars ! "
" very well , let it <unk> up ! " replied the <unk> , with a <unk> of the days of ancient <unk> .


" to get nearer the moon , perhaps ? " said the secretary of the gun club .
just at this moment a circumstance , the most unexpected , the most extraordinary and incredible , occurred to rouse afresh their panting spirits , and to throw every mind into a state of the most violent excitement .
as to the president , after having suggested to the visitors it was time to retire , he re-entered the passenger ' s cabin , and remained there till the bell of the steamer made it midnight .
the assembly , strongly <unk> as they were in favor of the french hero , were slightly staggered at this bold theory . michel ardan perceived the fact .
" gentlemen , " he continued with a pleasant smile , " you do not seem quite convinced . very good ! let us reason the matter out . do you know how long it would take for an express train to reach the moon ? three hundred days ; no more ! and what is that ? the distance is no more than nine times the circumference of the earth ; and there are no sailors or travelers , of even moderate activity , who have not made longer journeys than that in their lifetime . and now consider that i shall be only <unk> seven hours on my journey . ah ! i see you are reckoning that the moon is a long way off from the earth , and that one must think twice before making the experiment . what would you say , then , if we were talking of going to neptune , which revolves at a distance of more than two thousand seven hundred and twenty millions of miles from the sun ! and yet what is that compared with the distance of the fixed stars , some of which , such as <unk> , are billions of miles distant from us ? and then you talk of the distance which separates the planets from the sun ! and there are people who affirm that such a thing as distance exists . absurdity , folly , <unk> nonsense ! would you know what i think of our own solar universe ? shall i tell you my theory ? it is very simple ! in my opinion the solar system is a solid homogeneous body ; the planets which compose it are in actual contact with each other ; and whatever space exists between them is nothing more than the space which separates the molecules of the <unk> metal , such as silver , iron , or platinum ! i have the right , therefore , to affirm , and i repeat , with the conviction which must penetrate all your minds , <unk> is but an empty name ; distance does not really exist ! ' "
" really ? "
" no ! "
for another hour their search was continued . the greater part of the wood had been explored . there was nothing to reveal the presence of the combatants . the information of the bushman was after all doubtful , and ardan was about to propose their abandoning this useless pursuit , when all at once maston stopped .
" what is it ? " asked nicholl with manifest incredulity .
two days later michel ardan received a message from the president of the united states , an honor of which he showed himself especially sensible .
ardan wished to convey a number of animals of different sorts , not indeed a pair of every known species , as he could not see the necessity of <unk> serpents , tigers , alligators , or any other noxious beasts in the moon . " nevertheless , " he said to barbicane , " some valuable and useful beasts , bullocks , cows , horses , and donkeys , would bear the journey very well , and would also be very useful to us . "
2 . the projectile , following an immutable law , will continue to gravitate round the moon till the end of time .
these questions determined president barbicane , assisted by murchison the engineer , to choose a spot situated in florida , in 20@ 7 ' north latitude , and <unk> 3 ' west ( greenwich ) longitude . it was on this spot , after stupendous labor , that the columbiad was cast with full success . things stood thus , when an incident took place which increased the interest attached to this great enterprise a hundredfold .

" nicholl , are we moving ? "
" my goodness , captain , " exclaimed michel ardan , " that hypothesis is not worthy of my brain ! it cannot be a serious one . for have we not been half annihilated by the shock ? did i not recall you to life ? is not the president ' s shoulder still bleeding from the blow it has received ? "
" let us first find out where we are , " said barbicane , " and let down this panel . "
" that is something ! " replied michel ardan , who for his life could not do addition right , and who defined the rule as a chinese puzzle , which allowed one to obtain all sorts of <unk> .
" but i have provided for the contingency , my friends , " replied michel ; " you have only to speak , and i have chess , draughts , cards , and dominoes at your disposal ; nothing is wanting but a <unk> . "
" formerly , " replied barbicane , " it was greatly <unk> ; but now , after the calculations of fourier , of the french academy of science , it is not supposed to exceed <unk> centigrade below zero . "
" no doubt about it . according to the ancients , the <unk> pretend that their ancestors inhabited the earth before the moon became her satellite . starting from this fact , some scientific men have seen in the moon a comet whose orbit will one day bring it so near to the earth that it will be held there by its attraction . "

" have you ever seen the moon ? " asked a professor , ironically , of one of his pupils .
" copernicus , " replied barbicane .
" very well ! " continued barbicane , " that astonishment is reserved for the selenites who inhabit the face of the moon opposite to the earth , a face which is ever invisible to our countrymen of the terrestrial globe . "
" well ! " observed michel , " we cannot reasonably complain of the monotony of our journey ! what variety we have had , at least in temperature . now we are blinded with light and saturated with heat , like the indians of the pampas ! now plunged into profound darkness , amid the cold , like the esquimaux of the north pole . no , indeed ! we have no right to complain ; nature does wonders in our honor . "
barbicane waited until half an hour had elapsed , which was more than time enough to allow the instrument to fall to the level of the surrounding temperature . then it was rapidly pulled in .
" pure mistake , " replied barbicane . " have you not seen shooting stars rush through the sky by thousands at certain seasons ? "
" but then , " asked michel , " i shall be curious to know how our <unk> vehicle will act in space ? "
it was like the opening of a crater , like the scattering of an immense conflagration . thousands of luminous fragments lit up and <unk> space with their fires . every size , every color , was there intermingled . there were rays of yellow and pale yellow , red , green , gray - a crown of fireworks of all colors . of the enormous and <unk> globe there remained nothing but these fragments carried in all directions , now become asteroids in their turn , some flaming like a sword , some surrounded by a whitish cloud , and others leaving behind them trains of brilliant cosmical dust .
" an ellipse . instead of losing itself in interplanetary space , it is probable that the projectile will describe an elliptical orbit around the moon . "
chapter xvii
" indeed , " continued michel . " it is enough to say that it is a vast star , similar to that produced by a ball or a stone thrown at a square of glass ! "
" because most probably then the rotary motion of the moon upon her axis was not equal to her revolution , an equality which presents each part of her disc during fifteen days to the action of the solar rays . "
" and you know these calculations ? "
chapter xix
" never , " interrupted michel .
" all is ready , " replied michel ardan , directing a lighted match to the flame of the gas .
" wait ! " said barbicane , holding his chronometer in his hand .
at this moment , barbicane , quitting his scuttle , turned to his two companions . he was frightfully pale , his forehead wrinkled , and his lips contracted .
" touch ! " cried at this moment one of the men at the <unk> , who was superintending the operation .
at this moment belfast ' s servant appeared on the platform ( it was ten at night ) and gave him a dispatch . it was the commander of the susquehanna ' s telegram .
<unk> <unk> in the book : >the book uses <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ; i have simply <unk> these <unk> . <unk> n is in <unk> . >the chapter titles are in small caps . >the first word of each chapter has an <unk> capital , <unk> the rest of the word is in small caps . if the first <unk> is two letters or less , the second word is also in <unk> caps . <unk> and <unk> are always in small caps , as a . m . or p . m .
" i am here , " replied the lieutenant .
the great slave lake is dotted with little islands , the granite and <unk> of which they are formed jutting up in several places . its northern banks are clothed with thick woods , shutting out the barren frozen district beyond , not <unk> called the " cursed land . " the southern regions , on the other band , are flat , without a rise of any kind , and the soil is mostly calcareous . the large ruminants of the polar <unk> buffaloes or <unk> , the flesh of which forms almost the only food of the canadian and native <unk> go further north than the great slave lake .
the troops , under the command of lieutenant jaspar hobson , were one chief and two subordinate officers , with ten soldiers , three of whom took their wives with them . they were all picked men , chosen by captain craventy on account of their energy and resolution . we <unk> a list of the whole party : -
lieutenant hobson suggested that they should do so .
" would not this be the time to approach them , when they are blinded with rage ? "
before ten o ' clock all the travellers were crouching in the snow houses , in groups of two or three , each choosing congenial companions . mrs barnett , madge , and lieutenant hobson occupied one hut , thomas black and sergeant long another , and so on . these retreats were warm , if not comfortable ; and the esquimaux and indians have no other refuge even in the bitterest cold . the adventurers could therefore fearlessly await the end of the storm as long as they took care not to let the openings of their holes become blocked up with the snow , which they had to <unk> away every half hour . so violent was the storm that even the lieutenant and his soldiers could scarcely set foot outside . fortunately , all were provided with sufficient food , and were able to endure their <unk> existence without suffering from cold or hunger
" bah ! " exclaimed the lieutenant ; " the hunting districts are vast , and there ' s room beneath the sun for everybody . as for us , let ' s make a start to begin with . let us press on as long as we have firm ground beneath our feet , and god be with us ! "
the second part of the journey would naturally be very different from the first . the rules with regard to the sledges keeping their rank need no longer be enforced , and each couple drove as it pleased them . only short distances were traversed at a time ; halts were made at every angle of the coast , and the party often walked . lieutenant hobson only urged two things upon his companions not to go further than three miles from the coast , and to rally their forces twice a day , at twelve o ' clock and in the evening . at night they all encamped in tents .
the spot chosen , hobson and mac-nab set out the outer walls of the house with the line . this outline formed a <unk> measuring sixty feet on the larger side , and thirty on the smaller . the facade of the house would therefore have a length of sixty feet it was to have a door and three windows on the side of the promontory , where the inner court was to be situated , and four windows on the side of the lagoon . the door was to open at the left corner , instead of in the middle , of the back of the house , for the sake of warmth . this arrangement would impede the entrance of the outer air to the further rooms , and add considerably to the comfort of the inmates of the fort .
" make chimneys of shells ! " cried the carpenter .
accordingly marbre and sabine , sometimes accompanied by the lieutenant and sergeant long , whose experience was invaluable , scoured the country daily for miles round ; and it was no uncommon sight to see mrs paulina barnett join them and step briskly along <unk> her gun bravely , and never allowing herself to be outstripped by her companions .
" a <unk> , ma ' am , " returned sabine , much delighted with the elegant way in which he had rounded his sentence .
the window shutters were hermetically closed , and the lamps were kept burning through the long hours of the sleepless night .
a few moments sufficed to renew the atmosphere of the house , and all unhealthy vapours were quickly dispersed by the introduction of a pure and refreshing current of air .
" but , lieutenant , " said mrs barnett , " can we not count upon a few days ' <unk> not all this snow be rapidly converted into water ? "
" yes it was , i remember only too well that the thermometer marked 70^0 below zero . "
during the 9 th and 0 th november , the cold did not decrease , and it was necessary to keep up huge fires to prevent the freezing in all the corners of the house of the moisture in the atmosphere . fortunately there was plenty of fuel , and it was not spared . a mean temperature of 50^0 fahrenheit was maintained indoors in spite of the intensity of the cold without .
no description could give an adequate idea of the glory which flushed the northern sky , converting it into a vast dome of fire , but after the magnificent spectacle had been enjoyed for about half an hour , it suddenly <unk> fading gradually away after concentration of its rays , or a diminution of its splendour , but dying abruptly , as if an invisible hand had cut off the supply of electricity which gave it life .
although this temperature would have seemed very cold to the inhabitants of a temperate zone , it was easily endured by the colonists . the absence of wind made a great difference , and hobson having noticed that the upper layers of snow were becoming <unk> , ordered his men to clear it away from the outer approaches of the enceinte . mac-nab and his subordinates set to work zealously , and completed their task in a few days . the traps were now uncovered and <unk> . a good many footprints showed that there were plenty of furred animals about the cape , and as they could not get any other food , it was probable that the bait in the snares would soon attract them . in accordance with the advice of marbre the hunter , a reindeer trap was constructed in the esquimaux style . a trench was dug twelve feet deep , and of a uniform width of ten feet . a <unk> plank , which would rebound when lowered , was laid across it . a bait of herbs was placed at one end of the plank , and any animal venturing to take them , was inevitably flung to the bottom of the pit , and the plank immediately returning to its former position , would allow of the <unk> of another animal in the same manner . once in , there was no getting out . the only difficulty marbre had to contend with in making his trap , was the extreme hardness of the ground to be dug out , but both he and the lieutenant were not a little surprised at finding beneath some five feet of earth and sand a bed of snow , as hard as a rock , which appeared to be very thick .
under the circumstances the capture was easy . two balls carefully aimed put an end to the bear ' s life , and the next thing to do was to get it out of the pit . the two hunters returned to the fort for reinforcements , and ten of the soldiers , provided with ropes , returned with them . it was not without considerable difficulty that the body was hauled up . it was a huge creature , six feet long , weighing six hundred pounds , and must have possessed immense strength . it belonged to the <unk> of white bears , and had the flattened head , long neck , short and slightly curved claws , narrow muzzle , and smooth white fur characteristic of the species . the edible portions of this valuable animal were confided to mrs joliffe , and by her carefully prepared for the table .
the interesting native family remained encamped near cape esquimaux for eight days . the men passed twelve hours out of every twenty-four hunting morses . with a patience which none but sportsmen could understand , they would watch for the amphibious animals near the holes through which they come up to the surface of the ice-field to breathe . when the morse appears , a rope with a running noose is flung round its body a little below the head , and it is dragged on to the ice-field , often with considerable difficulty , and killed with hatchets . it is really more like fishing than hunting . it is considered a great treat to drink the warm blood of the walrus , and the esquimaux often indulge in it to excess .
it would not do , however , to rejoice too soon . the winter had still to last three months . the sun would doubtless reappear above the horizon in due time ; but there was no reason to think that the cold had reached its maximum intensity , especially as in most northern countries february is the month during which the temperature falls lowest . however that might be , there was no decrease in the severity of the weather during the first days of the new year , and on the 8 th january the alcohol thermometer placed outside the window of the passage marked 60^0 below zero . a few degrees more and the minimum temperature at fort reliance in 1800 would be reached !
" we shall be out of wood soon ! "
the following were the precautions taken to save the lives of those who were about to risk themselves for the sake of the general good : -
it was now debated whether it would be better to go and attack the besiegers , or to remain on the defensive . only one soldier could get through the narrow trap-door at a time , and this made hobson hesitate , and finally resolve to wait . the sergeant and others , whose bravery none could doubt , agreed that he was in the right , and it might be possible that some new incident would occur to modify the situation . it was almost impossible for the bears to break through the beams of the ceiling , as they had the rafters of the roof , so that there was little fear that they would get on to the ground-floor .
during the month of july hunting the furred animals was discontinued , as the martens , foxes , and others had already lost their winter beauty . no game was brought down but that required for food , such as <unk> , polar hares , &c . , which , strange to say , instead of being scared away by the guns , continued to multiply near the fort . mrs barnett did not fail to note this peculiar , and , as the event proved , significant fact .
iv .
the lieutenant frowned .
" you needn ' t be afraid , " said hobson with a smile ; " and you can tell your brave comrades that our mistake , which is really inexplicable , will not in the least prejudice your interests . we are not below , but above the seventieth parallel , and so you will get your double pay . "
it was indeed a most anxious moment , and the following result was arrived at .
" no , sir , no , " replied marbre , with some embarrassment .
hobson did not mean to follow the coast , the windings of which would have taken him a long way round , and have brought him face to face with the wind , which swept over the sea with nothing to break its fury . his idea was to cut across in a straight line from cape bathurst to cape michael , and he was provided with a pocket compass with which to ascertain his bearings . he hoped by this means to cross the ten or eleven miles between him and his goal , just before the twilight faded and gave place to the two hours of real darkness .
a few minutes passed by , and neither of the watchers were able to utter a word , so anxious were they lest the faint spark of life remaining to the young esquimaux should be quenched .
she did not hesitate a moment , her kayak was at hand , the frail bark in which she had more than once braved the storms of the arctic ocean , she pushed it down to the sea , hastily laced on the sealskin jacket fastened to the canoe , and , the long paddle in her hand , she plunged into the darkness .
it was then that she uttered the cry which hobson and long had heard .
it was a great success , and the colonists were delighted with this novel fishing . other walruses were taken in the same way , and furnished plenty of oil , which , though not strictly of the right sort , did very well for the lamps , and there was no longer any lack of light in any of the rooms of fort hope .
mrs barnett was anxious to accompany him , but he persuaded her to rest a little instead , and started off , accompanied only by sergeant long .
every moment the trembling of the ground and a loud report gave notice that another of these masses had rolled over , and there was a danger that the island would sink beneath the weight thrown upon it . a very apparent lowering of the level had taken place all along that part of the coast near cape bathurst , it was evidently gradually sinking down , and the sea had already encroached nearly as far as the lagoon .
it was now seventy-six hours since the avalanche fell upon the house !
the instruments and maps belonging to the astronomer were found in the ruins of the house , and were fortunately uninjured . the weather was cloudy , but hobson succeeded in taking the altitude of the sun with sufficient accuracy for his purpose .
on the 4 th may , mac-nab and his men commenced the construction of a huge raft . it had to be as high as possible above the water , to prevent the waves from breaking over it , so that it was really a formidable undertaking . the blacksmith , rae , had fortunately found a large number of the iron bolts which had been brought from fort reliance , and they were invaluable for firmly fastening together the different portions of the framework of the raft .
but a wreck , a piece of woodwork , a broken mast , or a few planks , remain floating ; they offer some resistance to the waves , they will not melt ; but this bit of ice , this solidified water , must dissolve with the heat of the sun !
and kellet turned towards the sea . mrs barnett , terrified at his manner , threw herself upon him and held him back . her cries brought hobson and long to her assistance , and they did all in their power to dissuade the unhappy man from carrying out his purpose , but he was not to be moved , and merely shook his head .
the speed increased as the wind freshened , but the ice was melting everywhere ; it trembled beneath the feet of the anxious watchers , and might open at any moment . but they would not think of that ; they were <unk> up with hope ; safety was at hand , on the land they were rapidly nearing . they <unk> made <unk> were in a delirium of excitement .
at half-past seven the ice was much nearer the land , but it was visibly melting , and sinking rapidly ; water was <unk> from it , and the waves were washing over it , sweeping off the terrified quadrupeds before the eyes of the colonists . every instant they expected the whole mass to be engulfed , and it was necessary to lighten it like a sinking vessel . every means was tried to check the dissolution ; the earth and sand were carefully spread about , especially at the edges of the ice , to protect it from the direct influence of the sunbeams ; and furs were laid here and there , as being bad <unk> of heat . but it was all of no avail ; the lower portion of the ice began to crack , and several fissures opened in the surface . it was now but a question of moments !
" god bless you , madam , for all you have been to us . you have been our <unk> , our <unk> , the very soul of our little world ; and i thank you in the name of all . "
" that ' s my belief too , " said the doctor .
" you have no lead ! "
" you know , doctor , " said hatteras , as they returned to the hut , " the polar bears subsist almost entirely on seals . they ' ll lie in wait for them beside the crevasses for whole days , ready to strangle them the moment their heads appear above the surface . it is not likely , then , that a bear will be frightened of a seal . "
" forward ! forward ! " shouted the doctor , hurrying towards hatteras , for the bear had reared on his hind legs , and was striking the air with one paw and tearing up the snow to stanch his wound with the other .
the doctor tried to blow the embers into a flame , but finding he could not even get a red spark , he went out to the sledge to fetch tinder , and get the steel from johnson .
" let us see what there is on board before we say much , " said johnson .
altamont was too feeble yet to take part in any work , so he remained on the ship , while the others commenced to explore the unknown continent .
hatteras was silent , but his lip quivered .
" fort providence , " added johnson , " sounds well too . in our future excursions , then , we shall go by cape washington to victoria bay , and from thence to fort providence , where we shall find food and rest at doctor ' s house ! "

" well , i will convince you it is fact , " returned clawbonny , and taking up a thermometer , he plunged it into the steaming coffee . he waited till the mercury rose as high as 100° and then withdrew it , and swallowed the liquid with evident <unk> .
bell tried to follow his example , but burnt his mouth severely .
" it is ; but <unk> , a learned frenchman , has proved the fact incontestably . if it were not the case , the difference between day and night would be far greater , as also the degree of cold at the poles . but now i think , friends , we should be the better of a few hours ' sleep . who has charge of the stove ? "
" ' the day after your <unk> appeared , there was an unusual and unprecedented demand for ink among us , and our green <unk> was deluged with <unk> and <unk> of <unk> , to the injury of one of our servants , who got a piece driven right under his nail . i know for a fact that sergeant martin had no less than nine <unk> to <unk> .
" you ' re a happy man , johnson , " said altamont , " to be blessed with such a fortunate organization . "
" i don ' t think so , " rejoined clawbonny . " it is more likely that they waited till the cessation of the tempest , and were on their way down to the bay , intending to catch seals , when they scented us . "
" by <unk> all the marks in a given place , and if to-morrow , we find fresh ones , it will be evident that fort providence is the goal for which the bears are bound . "
his companions followed his example silently . not a sound was heard but the low , deep growl of duk .
" look for yourself ; the poker can ' t get through . i declare it is getting absurd now . "

" but how did you know we had been attacked by a troop of bears ? " asked altamont . " what we were most afraid of was that you would come quickly back to fort providence , never dreaming of danger . "
" no , i took care to stop up the opening thoroughly , and now we can reach the powder-magazine without letting them see us . "
this was a frequent topic of thought and conversation with him , and one evening when he was going over all the old familiar arguments in support of his theory , altamont took up the subject , and declared his opinion that the polar basin extended west as well as east . but it was impossible for the american and englishman , to talk long about anything without coming to words , so intensely national were both . dr . kane was the first bone of contention on this occasion , for the jealous englishman was unwilling to grant his rival the glory of being a discoverer , <unk> his belief that though the brave adventurer had gone far north , it was by mere chance he had made a discovery .
[illustration : ]
after the sloop was made fast , they all got out and went after him . altamont was just going to climb to the top of a pile of stones , when the doctor exclaimed , " listen ! "
duk was not behind with his hurrah , which was worth quite as much as the others .
was not the purpose of his life attained now ? had he not realized his most daring project ? why could he not rest ? indeed , might not one have supposed that , after the strain his nervous system had undergone , he would long for rest ?
once more he shouted -
this done , the four men and the captain , a poor body without a soul , set out on the return voyage , accompanied by the faithful duk , who had become sad and downcast . a new sail was manufactured out of the tent , and about ten o ' clock , the little sloop sailed out before the wind .
" yes , " said altamont ; " let us collect what food remains , and be off at once . "

the first care of clawbonny was to request the royal geographical society to receive a communication from him . he was accordingly admitted to the next
the english have a passion for geographical discovery , from the lord to the <unk> , from the merchant down to the dock <unk> , and the news of this grand discovery speedily flashed along the telegraph wires , throughout the length and breadth of the kingdom . hatteras was <unk> as a martyr by all the newspapers , and every englishman felt proud of him .
