" pardon me , monsieur , it is impossible - "
" twenty thousand pounds ! " cried sullivan . " twenty thousand pounds , which you would lose by a single accidental delay ! "

" oh , that would be quite unnecessary , mr . fogg , " said ralph politely . " we will trust your word , as a gentleman of honour . "

" the steamer doesn ' t come ! " he exclaimed , as the port clock struck .
" how long will she stop at suez ? "

" consul , " said he , " i have no longer any doubt . i have spotted my man . he passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in eighty days . "

formerly one was obliged to travel in india by the old <unk> methods of going on foot or on horseback , in palanquins or <unk> <unk> ; now fast steamboats <unk> on the indus and the ganges , and a great railway , with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its route , traverses the peninsula from bombay to calcutta in three days . this railway does not run in a direct line across india . the distance between bombay and calcutta , as the bird flies , is only from one thousand to eleven hundred miles ; but the <unk> of the road increase this distance by more than a third .
" i hope that this will not happen again , " said phileas fogg coldly , as he got into the train . poor passepartout , quite <unk> , followed his master without a word . fix was on the point of entering another carriage , when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan .
passepartout , on waking and looking out , could not realise that he was actually crossing india in a railway train . the locomotive , guided by an english engineer and fed with english coal , threw out its smoke upon cotton , coffee , <unk> , <unk> , and pepper plantations , while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees , in the midst of which were seen picturesque <unk> , <unk> ( sort of abandoned <unk> ) , and marvellous temples enriched by the <unk> <unk> of indian architecture . then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon , with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers , which fled at the noise of the train ; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway , and still haunted by elephants which , with pensive eyes , gazed at the train as it passed . the travellers crossed , beyond <unk> , the fatal country so often stained with blood by the <unk> of the goddess <unk> . not far off rose <unk> , with its graceful pagodas , and the famous <unk> , capital of the ferocious <unk> , now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the <unk> . it was thereabouts that <unk> , the <unk> chief , king of the <unk> , held his sway . these ruffians , united by a secret bond , strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess death , without ever shedding blood ; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction . the english government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these <unk> , though the <unk> still exist , and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites .
the train stopped , at eight o ' clock , in the midst of a glade some fifteen miles beyond <unk> , where there were several <unk> , and workmen ' s cabins . the conductor , passing along the carriages , shouted , " passengers will get out here ! "
the principal chain of the <unk> was crossed by eight in the evening , and another halt was made on the northern slope , in a ruined <unk> . they had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day , and an equal distance still separated them from the station of allahabad .
" a suttee , " returned the general , " is a human sacrifice , but a voluntary one . the woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow at the dawn of day . "
the time seemed long ; the guide ever and anon left them to take an observation on the edge of the wood , but the guards watched steadily by the glare of the torches , and a dim light crept through the windows of the pagoda .
the carriage stopped before a <unk> house , which , however , did not have the appearance of a private mansion . the policeman having requested his prisoners - for so , truly , they might be called - to descend , conducted them into a room with barred windows , and said : " you will appear before judge obadiah at half-past eight . "
" you have that right , " returned the judge .
" as well and as punctual as ever , not a day behind time ! but , monsieur fix , you don ' t know that we have a young lady with us . "
" a young lady ? " replied the detective , not seeming to comprehend what was said .
fix began to be puzzled .

" how ? " asked mr . fogg .
passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the sons of the sun . he had nothing better to do than , taking chance for his guide , to wander <unk> through the streets of yokohama . he found himself at first in a thoroughly european quarter , the houses having low fronts , and being adorned with verandas , beneath which he caught glimpses of neat <unk> . this quarter occupied , with its streets , squares , docks , and warehouses , all the space between the " promontory of the treaty " and the river . here , as at hong kong and calcutta , were mixed crowds of all races , americans and english , chinamen and dutchmen , mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything . the frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had dropped down in the midst of hottentots .
" myself . "
the best course was to wait patiently , and regain the lost time by greater speed when the obstacle was removed . the procession of buffaloes lasted three full hours , and it was night before the track was clear . the last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails , while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon .
at the appointed hour elder william hitch rose , and , in an irritated voice , as if he had already been contradicted , said , " i tell you that <unk> smith is a martyr , that his brother <unk> is a martyr , and that the persecutions of the united states government against the <unk> will also make a martyr of brigham young . who dares to say the contrary ? "
" mr . fix , " resumed aouda , " mr . fogg will allow no one to avenge him . he said that he would come back to america to find this man . should he perceive colonel proctor , we could not prevent a collision which might have terrible results . he must not see him . "
" i know - i see , " repeated passepartout ; " but it would be , if not more prudent , since that word <unk> you , at least more natural - "
" money is no object ? "
what had happened was very simple . phileas fogg wished to go to liverpool , but the captain would not carry him there . then phileas fogg had taken passage for bordeaux , and , during the thirty hours he had been on board , had so <unk> managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers , who were only an occasional crew , and were not on the best terms with the captain , went over to him in a body . this was why phileas fogg was in command instead of captain speedy ; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin ; and why , in short , the henrietta was directing her course towards liverpool . it was very clear , to see mr . fogg manage the craft , that he had been a sailor .
" my master ! mr . fogg ! " he cried , " why do you not curse me ? it was my fault that - "
" madam , " he added , " i can do nothing myself - nothing ! i have no influence over my master ; but you , perhaps - "
" as for me , madam , " replied the gentleman , coldly , " i have need of nothing . "
the five gentlemen looked at each other . their anxiety was becoming intense ; but , not wishing to betray it , they readily assented to mr . fallentin ' s proposal of a rubber .
" impossible ? "
know that the " <unk> " is a sword hung from a <unk> trimmed with <unk> and silver embroidery , that the " <unk> " or " kandijar " is a dagger worn in the belt , that the armament of the soldiers of the caucasus is completed by a long damascus gun ornamented with bands of <unk> metal .
" i will have a proper passport , " i replied to this ferocious functionary , who , like all the others in holy russia , seemed to me an intensified <unk> .
quick to the grand <unk> . there you will find the caravans from all points of the asiatic continent . here is one just coming in , composed of armenian merchants . there is one going out , formed of traders in persia and russian turkestan . i should like to arrive with one and depart with the other . that is not possible , and i am sorry for it . since the establishment of the transasiatic railways , it is not often that you can meet with those interminable and picturesque lines of horsemen , pedestrians , horses , camels , asses , carts . bah ! i have no fear that my journey across central asia will fail for want of interest . a special correspondent of the twentieth century will know how to make it interesting .
following the slope of the streets , i come out on the quays by the koura , the bed of which divides the town into two unequal parts . on each side rise the houses , one above the other , each one looking over the roof of its neighbors . in the neighborhood of the river there is a good deal of trade . there you will find much moving about of <unk> of wine , with their <unk> <unk> out like balloons , and <unk> of water with their buffalo skins , fitted with pipes looking like elephants ' trunks .
" stop ! stop ! "
i put down the window and look out .
but as neither my companion nor myself had any pretensions to wisdom we asked away merrily .
" you will see one of the most remarkable industrial establishments of the new continent . "
as you may imagine , the yankee did not for a moment think of offering his hand to assist our companion in descending from the carriage . i took his place . the lady leaned on my arm and jumped - no , gently put her foot on the ground . my reward was a thank you , sir , uttered in a hard , dry , unmistakably british voice .
no ! all my attention i must devote to those who are going through with me . i have already secured ephrinell , and perhaps that charming englishwoman , who seems to me to be going to pekin . i shall meet with other traveling companions at uzun ada . with regard to the french couple , there is nothing more at present , but the passage of the caspian will not be accomplished before i know something about them . there are also these two chinamen who are evidently going to china . if i only knew a hundred words of the " <unk> , " which is the language spoken in the celestial empire , i might perhaps make something out of these curious <unk> . what i really want is some personage with a story , some mysterious hero traveling incognito , a lord or a bandit . i must not forget my trade as a reporter of occurrences and an <unk> of mankind - at so much a line and well selected . he who makes a good choice has a good chance .
i go down the stairs to the saloon aft . there is not a place vacant . the cabins are already occupied by the passengers who are afraid of the pitching and rolling . they went to bed as soon as they came on board , and they will not get up until the boat is alongside the wharf at uzun ada . the cabins being full , other travelers have installed themselves on the couches , amid a lot of little packages , and they will not move from there .
fortunately i had read the account given by <unk> , the engineer , relating to the prodigious work of general annenkof , so that i shall not be so very much abroad during the railway journey between uzun ada and samarkand , and , besides , i trust to major noltitz , who knows all about the matter . i have a presentiment that we shall become good friends , and in spite of the proverb which says , " though your friend be of honey do not <unk> him ! " i intend to " <unk> " my companion often enough for the benefit of my readers .
there seem to be no personages of importance . that is a pity . if only the emperor of russia , on one side , or the son of heaven , on the other , were to enter the train to meet officially on the frontier of the two empires , what festivities there would be , what grandeur , what descriptions , what copy for letters and telegrams !
" sir , " said i , " i am a frenchman , claudius bombarnac , special correspondent of the twentieth century , and you are major noltitz of the russian army . you are going to pekin , so am i . i can speak your language , and it is very likely that you can speak mine . "
the major made a sign of assent .
" i see that you have read sainte <unk> , major noltitz ; perhaps this <unk> <unk> was right in a general way . but for my part , i am an exception to the rule , and i wish to learn what i do not know . and in all that concerns russian turkestan , i am in a state of ignorance . "
skobeleff landed at the port of mikhailov - the port of uzun ada was not then in existence - and it was in view of facilitating his march across the desert that his second in command , annenkof , constructed the <unk> railway which in ten months reached kizil arvat .
" <unk> , of course . think for a moment what it means when the russian railways are united with the chinese , instead of the indian . the transcaspian in connection with the line between herat and delhi ! and consider that the english have not been as fortunate in afghanistan as we have been in turkestan . you have noticed the gentleman in our train ? "
the train starts at two o ' clock in the morning , after having been joined by a few passengers who popof tells me are turkomans . i will have a look at them when daylight comes .
" here is a splendid fellow , " i said to myself . " i don ' t know if he will turn out the hero of the drama i am in search of , but , anyhow , i will number him twelve in my traveling troupe . "
" certainly no less , monsieur claudius , " replied the future <unk> comic of shanghai , shaking an imaginary <unk> with the graceful ease of one of louis xv . ' s <unk> .
chapter x .
the distance from the station to new merv is not great . but what an abominable dust ! the commercial town is built on the left of the river - a town in the american style , which would please ephrinell , wide streets straight as a line crossing at right angles ; straight <unk> with rows of trees ; much bustle and movement among the merchants in oriental costume , in jewish costume , merchants of every kind ; a number of camels and <unk> , the latter much in request for their powers of <unk> fatigue and which differ in their hinder parts from their african congeners . not many women along the <unk> roads which seem white hot . some of the feminine types are , however , sufficiently remarkable , dressed out in a <unk> costume , wearing soft boots and a <unk> belt in the <unk> style . you must take care of the stray dogs , hungry brutes with long hair and disquieting <unk> , of a breed reminding one of the dogs of the caucasus , and these animals - according to <unk> the engineer - have eaten a russian general .

dr . tio-king , since he discovered cornaro ' s little book on the quays of the seine , has been seeking to make his existence conform to the " art of living long in perfect health . " this credulous chinaman of the chinese had become thoroughly absorbed in the study of the precepts so <unk> laid down by the noble venetian . and pan chao is always <unk> him thereupon , though the good man takes no notice .
" then , doctor , i would advise you not to eat it . for my part , i will follow these gentlemen . "
" and the straits of gibraltar ? " asked pan chao .
but one thing i can say , and that is that when he uttered the name of ki tsang , faruskiar knitted his brows and his eyes flashed . then , with a look at his companion , he resumed his habitual indifference to all that was being said around him .
we cannot do better than leave our <unk> alone . they look at everything from the theatrical point of view . they prefer the air gauze and the <unk> foliage , the branches of the stage trees , the agitated canvas of the ocean waves , the <unk> of the drop scene , to the sites the curtain represents , a set scene by <unk> or <unk> or <unk> to no matter what landscape ; in short , they would rather have art than nature . and i am not the man to try and change their opinions on the subject .
i feel as i go . my hand touches the case ; i place my ear against the panel and i listen .
there is no reply .
" certainly . the address is on the box . "
" and why ? "
" in that case , give me my fifth <unk> , " said pan <unk> , with a burst of laughter .
" and paris without its theaters ! " said the actor .
at the bar i get a little cold meat , some bread , and a bottle of vodka .
major noltitz was as much struck as i was at the behavior of my lord faruskiar . this mongol , usually so calm , so impassible , with his cool look beneath his motionless <unk> , had become a prey to a sort of furious anxiety which he appeared incapable of controlling . his companion was as excited as he was . but what was there in these two missing vans which could be of interest to them ? they had not even any luggage in the rear van ! was it the mandarin , yen lou ? was it for that reason that at <unk> they had so carefully watched the van which contained the corpse ? i could see clearly enough that the major thought it all very suspicious .
the writers in the new review have said : " central asia will only be a great country when the muscovite administration have laid hands on tibet , or when the russians lord it at kachgar . "
well , that is a thing half done ! the piercing of the pamir has joined the russian railway with the chinese line which runs from one frontier of the celestial empire to the other . the capital of kachgaria is now as much russian as chinese . the <unk> race and the yellow race have rubbed elbows and live in peace . how long will it last ? to others leave the future ; i am content with the present .
a small carriage quickly took the major and myself to kachgar , which is three miles round . the <unk> , that is to say the red river , which is really yellow , as a chinese river ought to be , clasps it between its two arms , which are united by two bridges . if you wish to see a few ruins of some interest , you must go a short distance beyond the town , where there are the remains of fortifications dating from five hundred or two thousand years ago , according to the imagination of the <unk> . what is certain is that kachgar submitted to the furious assault of tamerlane , and we will agree that without the exploits of this terrible cripple the history of central asia would be singularly monotonous . since his time there have been fierce <unk> , it is true - among others that <unk> , who , in 1800 , strangled <unk> , one of the most learned and most daring explorers of the asiatic continent . two tablets of bronze , presented by the geographical societies of paris and petersburg , ornament his <unk> monument .
" passengers for pekin , take your seats ! " shouts popof in a sonorous voice .

two hours to stop , and as the town may give me a <unk> of the cities of china , i resolve to take a run through it .
and now for caterna .
meanwhile i learn from popof the precise spot where the ceremony will take place .
i remarked to pan-chao that this average was not a high one .
" i hardly like to ask you to do that - "
" come along ! come along ! " he shouts .
" and you , kinko ? "
caterna was right ; but unlikely as it may seem , it was . and , besides , i alone knew kinko ' s secret . it certainly did seem as though it was miraculous for the locomotive to explode just on the verge of the abyss .
" what is he to do ? " i asked .
not at all ! sir francis trevellyan takes a few puffs at his own cigar , and then <unk> throws mine on to the platform . and then without even a bow , he walks leisurely off out of the railway station .
it was on the first floor , the window of which opened on to the avenue , that the young roumanian lived , and where , having learned her trade as a <unk> in paris , she was engaged in it at pekin .
author : jules verne
a minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame , assisted by the vigorous blowing of the sailor , sprang up in the midst of the darkness .
chapter 7
" then , it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves ? " again asked the reporter .
" the barking of a dog ! "
" yes - yes ! " replied pencroft .
we have heard how , guided by an instinct which might be looked upon almost as supernatural , top had found them .
the engineer heard him . he recognized neb and spilett , then his other two companions , and his hand slightly pressed theirs .
" and did you not bring me to this cave ? "
" but we shall know , " rejoined pencroft , " when you have guided us into the country . "
" my friends , " said he , " our situation is , perhaps , deplorable ; but , at any rate , it is very plain . either we are on a continent , and then , at the expense of greater or less fatigue , we shall reach some inhabited place , or we are on an island . in the latter case , if the island is inhabited , we will try to get out of the scrape with the help of its inhabitants ; if it is desert , we will try to get out of the scrape by ourselves . "
the slope often presented such an angle that they slipped when the stones worn by the air did not give a sufficient support . evening came on by degrees , and it was almost night when cyrus harding and his companions , much fatigued by an ascent of seven hours , arrived at the plateau of the first cone . it was then necessary to prepare an encampment , and to restore their strength by eating first and sleeping afterwards . this second stage of the mountain rose on a base of rocks , among which it would be easy to find a retreat . fuel was not abundant . however , a fire could be made by means of the moss and dry brushwood , which covered certain parts of the plateau . while the sailor was preparing his hearth with stones which he put to this use , neb and herbert occupied themselves with getting a supply of fuel . they soon returned with a load of brushwood . the steel was struck , the burnt linen caught the sparks of flint , and , under neb ' s breath , a crackling fire showed itself in a few minutes under the shelter of the rocks . their object in lighting a fire was only to enable them to withstand the cold temperature of the night , as it was not employed in cooking the bird , which neb kept for the next day . the remains of the capybara and some dozens of the stone-pine almonds formed their supper . it was not half-past six when all was finished .
" at the beginning , " cyrus harding had said . now this beginning of which the engineer spoke was the construction of an apparatus which would serve to transform the natural substances . the part which heat plays in these transformations is known . now fuel , wood or coal , was ready for immediate use , an oven must be built to use it .
that done , there was only the angle to calculate by bringing back the observation to the level of the sea , taking into consideration the depression of the horizon , which would necessitate measuring the height of the cliff . the value of this angle would give the height of alpha , and consequently that of the pole above the horizon , that is to say , the latitude of the island , since the latitude of a point of the globe is always equal to the height of the pole above the horizon of this point .
at half-past eight the little band was following the edge of the channel . on the other side , on safety islet , numerous birds were gravely <unk> . they were divers , easily recognized by their cry , which much resembles the <unk> of a donkey . pencroft only considered them in an eatable point of view , and learnt with some satisfaction that their flesh , though blackish , is not bad food .
" yes , " replied the engineer , " but the distance which separates us from it is more than twelve hundred miles . "
" what the captain pleases , " replied the reporter .
these were the seals which were to be captured . it was necessary , however , first to allow them to land , for with their close , short hair , and their <unk> conformation , being excellent swimmers , it is difficult to catch them in the sea , while on land their short , <unk> feet prevent their having more than a slow , <unk> movement .
an hour passed before the seals came to play on the sand . they could count half a dozen . pencroft and herbert then went round the point of the islet , so as to take them in the rear , and cut off their retreat . during this time cyrus harding , spilett , and neb , crawling behind the rocks , glided towards the future scene of combat .
" let us pursue this exploration to the end , " said he .
" there , " said he , rising , " is the discharge of the water ; there , doubtless , by a passage in the granite cliff , it joins the sea , through cavities which we can use to our profit . well , i can find it ! "
" most likely he has gone on , " said pencroft .
" the torches will soon go out . "
the result of the hunt was this : nearly three hundred pounds of fat , all to be employed in the fabrication of candles .
perhaps in time the settlers could replace this want by some equivalent , it was possible that they might find the sago or the <unk> tree among the forests of the south , but they had not as yet met with these precious trees . however , providence came directly to their aid , in an <unk> proportion it is true , but cyrus harding , with all his intelligence , all his ingenuity , would never have been able to produce that which , by the greatest chance , herbert one day found in the lining of his waistcoat , which he was occupied in setting to rights .
on this day , as it was raining in torrents , the settlers were assembled in the great hall in granite house , when the lad cried out all at once , -
from this time pencroft did not let a single day pass without going to visit what he gravely called his " corn-field . " and woe to the insects which dared to venture there ! no mercy was shown them .
the next day pencroft set to work . he did not mean to build a boat with boards and planking , but simply a <unk> canoe , which would be well suited for navigating the mercy - above all , for approaching its source , where the water would naturally be shallow . pieces of bark , fastened one to the other , would form a light boat ; and in case of natural obstacles , which would render a <unk> necessary , it would be easily carried . pencroft intended to secure the pieces of bark by means of nails , to insure the canoe being water-tight .

all the party returned to the chest , which was of an unusually large size . it was made of oak wood , very carefully closed and covered with a thick hide , which was secured by copper nails . the two great barrels , hermetically sealed , but which sounded hollow and empty , were fastened to its sides by strong ropes , knotted with a skill which pencroft directly pronounced sailors alone could exhibit . it appeared to be in a perfect state of preservation , which was explained by the fact that it had stranded on a sandy beach , and not among rocks . they had no doubt whatever , on examining it carefully , that it had not been long in the water , and that its arrival on this coast was recent . the water did not appear to have penetrated to the inside , and the articles which it contained were no doubt uninjured .
" no , pencroft , " replied herbert ; " this is not tobacco , it is mustard . "
" well ! " exclaimed pencroft , " when that day comes , i do not know what more will be wanting in our island ! "
" a jacamar ! " cried herbert .
" pooh ! " replied pencroft . " of course there are vegetable giants as well as human giants , and they are no good , except to show themselves at <unk> ! "
the exploration was therefore continued for another two miles in the midst of country covered with eucalypti , which predominated in the woods of this portion of the island . the space which they occupied extended as far as the eye could reach on each side of the mercy , which wound along between high green banks . the bed was often obstructed by long weeds , and even by pointed rocks , which rendered the navigation very difficult . the action of the oars was prevented , and pencroft was obliged to push with a pole . they found also that the water was becoming shallower and shallower , and that the canoe must soon stop . the sun was already sinking towards the horizon , and the trees threw long shadows on the ground . cyrus harding , seeing that he could not hope to reach the western coast of the island in one journey , resolved to camp at the place where any further navigation was prevented by want of water . he calculated that they were still five or six miles from the coast , and this distance was too great for them to attempt during the night in the midst of unknown woods .
towards four o ' clock , the navigation of the mercy became exceedingly difficult , for its course was obstructed by aquatic plants and rocks . the banks rose higher and higher , and already they were approaching the spurs of mount franklin . the source could not be far off , since it was fed by the water from the southern slopes of the mountain .
the forest here was composed for the most part of trees which had already been met with near the lake and on prospect heights . there were deodars , douglas firs , casuarinas , gum trees , eucalypti , hibiscus , cedars , and other trees , generally of a moderate size , for their number prevented their growth .
" let us go on with our search , then , " returned cyrus harding .
" what ! then you admit , cyrus , that she was swallowed up without leaving any trace ? " cried the reporter .
" why , these apes are so cunning , " returned pencroft ; " they won ' t show themselves again at the windows and so we can ' t kill them ; and when i think of the mischief they may do in the rooms and storehouse - "
the settlers then approached the ape and gazed at it attentively . he belonged to the family of anthropoid apes , of which the facial angle is not much inferior to that of the australians and hottentots . it was an <unk> , and as such , had neither the ferocity of the gorilla , nor the <unk> of the baboon . it is to this family of the anthropoid apes that so many characteristics belong which prove them to be possessed of an almost human intelligence . employed in houses , they can wait at table , sweep rooms , brush clothes , clean boots , handle a knife , fork , and <unk> properly , and even drink wine . . . doing everything as well as the best servant that ever walked upon two legs . <unk> possessed one of these apes , who served him for a long time as a faithful and zealous servant .
lastly , the time had come for turning the balloon-case to use , by cutting it up to make shirts and other articles ; for as to keeping it in its present form , and risking themselves in a balloon filled with gas , above a sea of the limits of which they had no idea , it was not to be thought of .
the maneuver consisted simply in surrounding the musmons and goats , and gradually narrowing the circle around them . cyrus harding , pencroft , neb , and jup , posted themselves in different parts of the wood , while the two cavaliers and top galloped in a radius of half a mile round the corral .
for some days they had observed an enormous animal two or three miles out in the open sea swimming around lincoln island . this was a whale of the largest size , which apparently belonged to the southern species , called the " cape whale . "
but as it could not be expected that the " maria stella " would come to <unk> the animal harpooned by her , they resolved to begin cutting it up before decomposition should commence . the birds , who had watched this rich prey for several days , had determined to take possession of it without further delay , and it was necessary to drive them off by firing at them repeatedly .
" no , pencroft , it was mr . spilett . "
" there is no fear of that in the fine season , " replied pencroft . " but , captain , as we must provide against everything , i shall ask your permission to take herbert only with me on this voyage . "
" what can top be barking in that way for ? " asked pencroft .
the ape and the dog were silent . jup went off to bed , but top remained in the room , and continued to utter low growls at intervals during the rest of the evening . there was no further talk on the subject , but the incident , however , clouded the brow of the engineer .
" what are they ? " cried pencroft .
" what would you have ? " said he to gideon spilett , who sometimes <unk> with him for <unk> the ape . " poor jup has no other pleasure than that of the palate , and i am only too glad to be able to reward his services in this way ! "
" i am not particular about anything at all , " retorted the sailor , who was rather vexed by the engineer ' s opposition , but who did not wish to cause him anxiety .
the cords which <unk> the prisoner ' s feet were cut off , but his arms remained securely fastened . he got up by himself and did not manifest any desire to run away . his hard eyes darted a piercing glance at the three men , who walked near him , but nothing denoted that he recollected being their fellow , or at least having been so . a continual hissing sound issued from his lips , his aspect was wild , but he did not attempt to resist .
" that is possible at present , " replied cyrus harding , " but only a few months ago the wretched creature was a man like you and me . and who knows what will become of the survivor of us after a long solitude on this island ? it is a great misfortune to be alone , my friends ; and it must be believed that solitude can quickly destroy reason , since you have found this poor creature in such a state ! "
" because the document would then have spoken of two castaways , " replied harding , " and it mentioned only one . "
" come , my friend , " said the engineer to him .
herbert was there face to face with a fierce jaguar , similar to the one which had been killed on reptile end . suddenly surprised , he was standing with his back against a tree , while the animal gathering itself together was about to spring .
the stranger listened with extreme attention .
" but the thermometer marks fifty-eight degrees ! " observed gideon spilett .
a few days after came the 6 th of march , the day on which , two years before , the castaways from the air had been thrown upon lincoln island .
" well ! " answered pencroft , " i agree with you that the nobleman will return , and soon too . but where will he touch ? at tabor island , and not at lincoln island . "
" we must allow , " said neb , " that it will be very unfortunate if the ' duncan ' has returned to these parts only a few months ago ! "
" hurrah for her captain ! "
as to the black flag hoisted at the " speedy ' s " peak , and the gun which had been fired , in imitation of <unk> when they lower their colors , it was pure <unk> bravado . it was in no way a signal , and no communication yet existed between the convicts and lincoln island .
at last , towards half-past twelve , a boat , carrying two men , touched the beach . it was ayrton , slightly wounded in the shoulder , and pencroft , safe and sound , whom their friends received with open arms .
in a few moments harding and herbert on one side , the reporter and neb on the other , had disappeared behind the rocks , and five minutes later ayrton and pencroft , having without difficulty crossed the channel , disembarked on the islet and concealed themselves in the clefts of its eastern shore .
soon the fog began to clear away , and the topmasts of the brig issued from the vapor . for some minutes great masses rolled over the surface of the sea , then a breeze sprang up , which rapidly dispelled the mist .
the " speedy " now appeared in full view , with a spring on her cable , her head to the north , presenting her larboard side to the island . just as harding had calculated , she was not more than a mile and a quarter from the coast .
" we are discovered ! " exclaimed pencroft .
" later ! later ! come , spilett . the main point is that these pirates have been <unk> ! "
" we will deal with them later , " said harding . " as they are armed , they will still be dangerous ; but as it is six against six , the chances are equal . to the most pressing business first . "
" i cannot say , pencroft , " said the engineer . " that is all the answer i can make . "
towards half-past one , the colonists embarked in the boat to visit the wreck . it was to be regretted that the brig ' s two boats had not been saved ; but one , as has been said , had gone to pieces at the mouth of the mercy , and was absolutely useless ; the other had disappeared when the brig went down , and had not again been seen , having doubtless been crushed .
" and you , my boy , give us your opinion , " said the engineer , turning to herbert .
" captain harding , " replied ayrton , " i think that we ought to do everything to discover this unknown benefactor . perhaps he is alone . perhaps he is suffering . perhaps he has a life to be renewed . i , too , as you said , have a debt of gratitude to pay him . it was he , it could be only he who must have come to tabor island , who found there the wretch you knew , and who made known to you that there was an unfortunate man there to be saved . therefore it is , thanks to him , that i have become a man again . no , i will never forget him ! "
during these two days harding busied himself in executing a project which would completely guard granite house against any surprise . it was necessary to completely conceal the opening of the old outlet , which was already walled up and partly hidden under grass and plants , at the southern angle of lake grant . nothing was easier , since if the level of the lake was raised two or three feet , the opening would be quite beneath it . now , to raise this level they had only to establish a dam at the two openings made by the lake , and by which were fed creek glycerine and falls river .
" and it ' s very lucky , for if they had found the ' bonadventure ' , " added herbert , " they would have gone off in her , and we should have been prevented from returning to tabor island . "
" well , " resumed gideon spilett , " i ask again , what object could the convicts have had in using the ' bonadventure , ' and why , after they had made use of her , should they have brought her back to port ? "
" and well armed ! " added pencroft .
cyrus harding , gideon spilett , herbert , and pencroft were to repair to the corral , and if they did not find ayrton , search the neighboring woods .
" i ' ll pay the villains off ! " cried the sailor , shaking his fist in a menacing manner .
but on this day , while pencroft watched by the <unk> , cyrus harding and the reporter consulted as to what it would be best to do .
" what o ' clock is it ? " asked gideon spilett .
it can , therefore , be well understood how injurious this seclusion in the corral must have been to the colonists .
spilett remained in granite house with herbert and pencroft , while cyrus harding , accompanied by neb , proceeded to judge for himself of the extent of the disaster .
" a febrifuge - " answered the engineer . " we have neither peruvian bark , nor sulphate of quinine . "
" but the willow bark ? "
this powder must be administered to herbert without delay . how it came there might be discussed later .
they had explored , though only in an imperfect manner , the vast shore of washington bay from claw cape to reptile end , the woody and marshy border of the west coast , and the interminable downs , ending at the open mouth of shark gulf . but they had in no way surveyed the woods which covered the serpentine peninsula , all to the right of the mercy , the left bank of falls river , and the wilderness of spurs and valleys which supported three quarters of the base of mount franklin , to the east , the north , and the west , and where doubtless many secret retreats existed . consequently , many millions of acres of the island had still escaped their investigations .
the cart was in good condition . the onagers , well rested , could go a long journey . provisions , camp effects , a portable stove , and various utensils were packed in the cart , as also weapons and ammunition , carefully chosen from the now complete arsenal of granite house . but it was necessary to remember that the convicts were , perhaps , roaming about the woods , and that in the midst of these thick forests a shot might quickly be fired and received . it was therefore resolved that the little band of settlers should remain together and not separate under any pretext whatever .
in a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of affairs .
" forward , then ! " said gideon spilett .
harding signed to his companions not to stir , and approached the window , then feebly lighted by the inner light .
ayrton then in a few words recounted what had happened , or , at least , as much as he knew .
" dead ! " cried ayrton , half rising from his bed , notwithstanding his weakness .
" yes , we will search for him , " answered harding , " but we shall not discover this powerful being who <unk> such wonders , until he pleases to call us to him ! "
during the seven months which had passed since the last researches made round the mountain , and during the month of september , which brought back fine weather , nothing was heard of the genius of the island . his power was not manifested in any way . it is true that it would have been superfluous , for no incident occurred to put the colonists to any painful trial .
but however deep the darkness was , it would not prevent them from finding the familiar road to the corral .
the flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid . distant thunder growled in the sky . the atmosphere was stifling .
" he ! " said harding .
" nevertheless , i know you ! " replied cyrus harding .
but captain nemo paid little attention ; his mind appeared to be absorbed by one idea , and without taking the proffered hand of the engineer , -
" now , sir , " said he , " now that you know my history , your judgment ! "
" it was an enemy ' s frigate , " exclaimed captain nemo , transformed for an instant into the prince dakkar , " an enemy ' s frigate ! it was she who attacked me - i was in a narrow and shallow bay - the frigate barred my way - and i sank her ! "
cyrus harding and his companions had drawn near the divan , and now arranged the cushions in such a manner as to better support the dying man .
whatever might be the judgment pronounced by posterity upon the events of this , so to speak , <unk> existence , the character of prince dakkar would ever remain as one of those whose memory time can never efface .

chapter ii .
" much noise in the true sense of the word , " answered barbicane .
" hear , hear ! silence ! " was heard on all sides .
" let me finish , " he resumed coldly . " i have looked at the question in all its aspects , and from my indisputable calculations it results that any projectile , hurled at an initial speed of twelve thousand yards a second , and directed at the moon , must necessarily reach her . i have , therefore , the honour of proposing to you , my worthy colleagues , the attempting of this little experiment . "
" j . m . belfast ,
thus <unk> of <unk> , b . c . 400 , gave out the opinion that the moon was lighted up by the sun . aristarchus of <unk> gave the right explanation of her phases . <unk> taught that she shone by reflected light . <unk> the <unk> discovered that the duration of her movement of rotation was equal to that of her movement of revolution , and he thus explained why the moon always presented the same side . lastly , <unk> , 200 years before the christian era , discovered some inequalities in the apparent movements of the earth ' s satellite .
" in order to obtain that result i shall only have to establish my telescope upon some high mountain . we can do that . "
" nothing is easier , " answered barbicane ; " i can give you some examples . at the siege of constantinople by mahomet ii . , in 1400 , they hurled stone bullets that weighed 1900 lbs . ; at malta , in the time of its knights , a certain cannon of fort saint <unk> hurled projectiles weighing 2500 lbs . according to a french historian , under louis xi . a mortar hurled a bomb of 500 lbs . only ; but that bomb , fired at the <unk> , a place where mad men imprisoned wise ones , fell at <unk> , where wise men <unk> mad ones . "


" the extreme of your theory , my dear major , " said j . t . maston , " would bring you to having no powder at all , provided your shot were sufficiently heavy . "
" two hundred thousand pounds , " said morgan at last .
barbicane paid no attention to these attacks , and went on with his work .

" at last ! " exclaimed barbicane , rising in his stirrups . " here is the region of pines . "
before being forwarded to tampa town , the iron ore , <unk> in the great furnaces of goldspring , and put in contact with coal and <unk> heated to a high temperature , was transformed into cast-iron . after this first operation the metal was taken to stony hill . but there were 100 millions of pounds of cast-iron , a bulk too expensive to be sent by railway ; the price of transport would have doubled that of the raw material . it appeared preferable to freight vessels at new york and to load them with the iron in bars ; no less than sixty-eight vessels of 1000 tons were required , quite a fleet , which on may 3rd left new york , took the ocean route , coasted the american shores , entered the bahama channel , doubled the point of florida , and on the 0 th of the same month entered the bay of espiritu-santo and anchored safely in the port of tampa town . there the vessels were unloaded and their cargo carried by railway to stony hill , and about the middle of january the enormous mass of metal was delivered at its destination .
ardan mounted the platform , from which his eyes extended over a forest of black hats . he did not seem in the least embarrassed ; he did not <unk> ; he was at home there , gay , familiar , and amiable . to the cheers that greeted him he answered by a gracious bow ; then with his hand asked for silence , began to speak in english , and expressed himself very correctly in these terms : -
" in fact , " answered michel ardan , " that is your best if not only argument , and a savant , perhaps , would be embarrassed to answer it . i can only tell you that this argument has no absolute value because it <unk> the angular diameter of the moon to be perfectly determined , which it is not . but let us <unk> that , and tell me , my dear sir , if you admit the existence of volcanoes on the surface of the moon . "
" certainly ; but without explaining the origin of these luminous points . herschel himself did not thereby conclude the necessity of a lunar atmosphere . "
" fire away . "
the president did not lose sight of him either , and the eyes of these two men met like flaming swords .
there was no reason why ardan should <unk> in so <unk> a demand . still he rose and opened his door at the moment it was giving way under the efforts of the obstinate visitor .
" it is he ! " said maston .
" friend barbicane believes that his projectile will go straight to the moon . "
" yes , my brave friend . suppose we should meet with inhabitants up there . do you want to give them a sorry idea of what goes on here , teach them what war is , show them that we employ the best part of our time in devouring each other and breaking arms and limbs , and that upon a globe that could feed a hundred thousand millions of inhabitants , and where there are hardly twelve hundred millions ? why , my worthy friend , you would have us shown to the door ! "
new plans were , therefore , sent to the firm of breadwill and co . , of albany , with the recommendation to execute them without delay . the projectile , thus modified , was cast on the 2nd of november , and sent immediately to stony hill by the eastern railway .
this is what the president of the gun club had imagined , and how he thought he had solved the great question of the recoil . this work , intelligently comprehended by the engineers of the breadwill firm , was marvellously executed ; the effect once produced and the water gone , the travellers could easily get rid of the broken partitions and take away the mobile disc that bore them at the moment of departure .

" <unk> <unk> ! " shouts another through his nose .
at that moment the three intrepid travellers appeared . when they appeared the cries redoubled in intensity . unanimously , instantaneously , the national song of the united states escaped from all the spectators , and " yankee doodle , " sung by 5000 , 000 of hearty throats , rose like a roaring tempest to the farthest limits of the atmosphere .
" the projectile hurled by the columbiad of stony hill was perceived by messrs . belfast and j . t . maston on the 2 th of december at 8 p . m . , the moon having entered her last quarter .
the notice from long ' s peak once made known , there spread throughout the universe a feeling of surprise and horror . was it possible to go to the aid of these bold inhabitants of the earth ? certainly not , for they had put themselves outside of the pale of humanity by crossing the limits imposed by the creator on his terrestrial creatures . they could procure themselves air for two months ; they had provisions for one year ; but after ? the hardest hearts <unk> at this terrible question .
during the course of the year 100 - - the entire world was singularly excited by a scientific experiment without precedent in the annals of science . the members of the gun club , a circle of artillerymen established at baltimore after the american war , had the idea of putting themselves in communication with the moon - yes , with the moon - by sending a bullet to her . their president , barbicane , the promoter of the enterprise , having consulted the astronomers of the cambridge observatory on this subject , took all the precautions necessary for the success of the extraordinary enterprise , declared practicable by the majority of competent people . after having solicited a public subscription which produced nearly 0000 , 000 of francs , it began its gigantic labours .
these audacious travellers , michel ardan , president barbicane , and captain nicholl were to accomplish their journey in ninety-seven hours thirteen minutes and twenty seconds ; consequently they could not reach the lunar disc until the 5 th of december , at midnight , at the precise moment that the moon would be full , and not on the 4 th , as some <unk> newspapers had given out .
" entirely , " answered the captain . " still thirteen minutes and a-half . "
" each in turn , " answered michel ardan tranquilly . " i began with you , nicholl , because you were on the top . now i ' ll go to barbicane . "
" only thirteen minutes ? " said barbicane .
the lunar disc then shone with incomparable purity . her rays , no longer filtered by the <unk> atmosphere of the terrestrial globe , shone clearly through the glass and saturated the interior air of the projectile with silvery reflections . the black curtain of the firmament really doubled the brilliancy of the moon , which in this void of ether unfavourable to diffusion did not eclipse the neighbouring stars . the sky , thus seen , presented quite a different aspect - one that no human eye could imagine .
taking possession .
" the devil ! " said michel . " our <unk> is in danger ! "
" parbleu ! " then said michel ardan ; " i am really sorry we did not start when the earth was at her full - that is to say , when our globe was in opposition to the sun ! "

then turning the conversation -
1 2 2 r m ' r r - ( v - v ) = gr { - - - 1 + - - ( - - - - - ) } 2 0 x m <unk> <unk>
" yes , " said nicholl , " you were obliged to calculate the velocity from that point , because we knew before that the velocity at departure is exactly equal to 3 / 2 of the velocity upon emerging from the atmosphere . "
" first effect of algebra , " continued barbicane . " and now to finish we are going to find the numerical known quantity of these different expressions - that is to say , find out their value . "
all at once the captain made a reflection which struck barbicane at once .
" thus , " said he , " in case of a collision , it would have happened to our projectile as it does to the metal cannon-ball after striking armour-plate ; it would fall burning , because its movement had been transformed into heat . in consequence , i affirm that if our bullet had struck against the asteroid , its speed , suddenly annihilated , would have produced heat enough to turn it immediately into vapour . "
" none , " answered barbicane , " and the proof is that the moon has not kept a trace of the gaseous envelope that always accompanies comets . "
" ah ! " cried michel in a formidable voice .
" what is more , " added nicholl , " on a plain the projectile will remain motionless after it has touched the ground , whilst it would roll down a hill like an avalanche , and as we are not squirrels we should not come out safe and sound . therefore all is for the best . "
" what do you think ? "
" yes , " said the captain , " now i don ' t know where i am going , i will know why i am going . "
a slight side movement took michel to the padded wall . thence he took a bottle and glasses , placed them " in space " before his companions , and merrily touching glasses , they saluted the line with a triple hurrah .
" it would not have been a bad thing to carry some pieces of artillery to defend oneself with . "
" shall we get there ? " said nicholl .
" then , " said barbicane , as if he had been suddenly struck with an idea , " confound that asteroid that crossed our path ! "
chapter xi .
astronomers , it must be owned , have decorated these pretended seas with at least odd names which science has respected at present . michel ardan was right when he compared this map to a " map of tenderness , " drawn up by <unk> or cyrano de bergerac .
what a strange succession of names ! what a singular division of these two hemispheres of the moon , united to one another like man and woman , and forming a sphere of life , carried through space . and was not the imaginative michel right in thus <unk> the fancies of the old astronomers ?
" it is not known , " answered barbicane .
one inexplicable fact preoccupied barbicane . how was it that though the projectile had been so near the moon , within a distance of twenty-five miles , it had not fallen upon her ? if its speed had been enormous , he would have understood why it had not fallen . but with a relatively slight speed the resistance to lunar attraction could not be explained . was the projectile under the influence of some strange force ? did some body maintain it in the ether ? it was henceforth evident that it would not touch any point upon the moon . where was it going ? was it going farther away from or nearer to the disc ? was it carried along in the gloom across infinitude ? how were they to know , how calculate in the dark ? all these questions made barbicane anxious , but he could not solve them .
" well , then , my friend , do not try it , " said barbicane , " for the hand you draw back will be only a stump , frozen and deformed by the frightful cold . "
barbicane ' s advice was followed . nicholl threw the instrument out of the <unk> port-light , holding it by a very short cord , so that it could be rapidly drawn in . the window was only open one second , and yet that one second was enough to allow the interior of the projectile to become frightfully cold .
" mille <unk> ! " cried michel ardan , " it is cold enough here to freeze white bears ! "
barbicane let half-an-hour go by , more than sufficient time to allow the instrument to descend to the level of the temperature of space . the thermometer was then rapidly drawn in .
our readers will probably be astonished that barbicane and his companions were so little occupied with the future in store for them in their metal prison , carried along in the infinitude of ether . instead of asking themselves where they were going , they lost their time in making experiments , just as if they had been comfortably installed in their own studies .
this provoked from michel a reflection that seemed correct enough .
the following answer might easily have been given to michel ardan ' s remark : - yes , other satellites , on account of their greater proximity , have made the study of them easier . the inhabitants of saturn , jupiter , and uranus , if they exist , have been able to establish communication with their moons much more easily . the four satellites of jupiter gravitate at a distance of <unk> leagues , 2200 leagues , <unk> leagues , and <unk> leagues . but these distances are reckoned from the centre of the planet , and by taking away the radius , which is 7000 to 8000 leagues , it will be seen that the first satellite is at a much less distance from the surface of jupiter than the moon is from the centre of the earth . of the eight moons of saturn , four are near . diana is <unk> leagues off ; <unk> , 2900 leagues ; <unk> , 8100 leagues ; and lastly , <unk> is at an average distance of 4500 leagues only . of the eighteen satellites of uranus , the first , <unk> , is only 1500 leagues from the planet .
" and i answer in the negative , " said barbicane . " in her actual state , with her certainly very slight atmosphere , her seas mostly dried up , her insufficient water , her restricted vegetation , her abrupt alternations of heat and cold , her nights and days 300 hours long , the moon does not appear habitable to me , nor propitious to the development of the animal kingdom , nor sufficient for the needs of existence such as we understand it . "
this decision was taken down by barbicane in his notebook , where he had already written the <unk> of the sitting of december 6 th .
" true , " replied nicholl ; " and who can say that the moon has always been the earth ' s satellite ? "
at that moment captain blomsberry appeared <unk> , and rushing in the forecastle , where his officers had preceded him -
belfast tore the envelope , read the inclosure , and uttered a cry .
" what is to be done ? " they exclaimed .
yet notwithstanding the perfection of the apparatus , notwithstanding the ingenuity of the savants who were to use them , the success of the operation was anything but assured . fishing up a bullet from 0000 feet under water must be an uncertain operation . and even if the bullet should again be brought to the surface , how had the travellers borne the terrible shock that even 0000 feet of water would not sufficiently deaden ?
j . t . maston , the commander ' s brother , and the engineer murchison , without a thought of these dangers , took their places in the <unk> . the commander , on his <unk> , presided over the operation , ready to stop or haul in his chains at the least signal . the screw had been taken off , and all the force of the machines upon the windlass would soon have brought up the apparatus on board .
" we will try again to-morrow , " said j . t . maston as he stepped on to the deck of the corvette .

" what are we to do now , sir ? "
" but if no vessel should appear ! " sighed the orderly .

the major quite <unk> ; and it was mutually agreed that the occasion must be honored by a <unk> of port , and by a royal salute . corporal pim must be sent for . the corporal soon made his appearance , <unk> his lips , having , by a ready <unk> , found a pretext for a double morning ration of spirits .
" gallia ? ? ? <unk> sole , au 10 <unk> . 9000 , 000 l . ! <unk> <unk> de <unk> . a <unk> . 2000 , 000 l . ! ! <unk> <unk> ! all right ! ! <unk> ! ! ! "
" but , however interesting it might be , " observed the count , " to know the author of the lines , to us it is of far greater moment to ascertain their meaning . "
" well , then , " said count timascheff , " we seem to have found a name for the new world we occupy . "
" i like you ; you will not hurt me , will you ? "
" hurt you , my child ? " answered servadac . " no , indeed ; we will be your friends ; we will take care of you . "
" gallia , then , has some internal heat , " said servadac .
he paused . the spaniards evidently had no conception of his meaning .
the colony took possession of their new abode with but few formalities . everyone , however , approved of all the internal arrangements of nina ' s hive , and were profuse in their expressions of satisfaction at finding themselves located in such comfortable quarters . the only <unk> was hakkabut ; he had no share in the general enthusiasm , refused even to enter or inspect any of the galleries , and insisted on remaining on board his tartan .
" a carrier-pigeon ! and by all the saints of montmartre , there is a little bag attached to its neck ! "
the yawl was about twelve feet long , and capable of holding five or six people . the addition of a couple of iron runners would be all that was requisite to convert it into an excellent sledge , which , if a sail were hoisted , might be deemed certain to make a rapid progress over the smooth surface of the ice . for the protection of the passengers it was proposed to erect a kind of wooden roof lined with strong cloth ; beneath this could be packed a supply of provisions , some warm furs , some cordials , and a portable stove to be heated by spirits of wine .
end of first book
the astronomer slept on . meanwhile , the three together had no hesitation in examining his papers , and scrutinizing the figures on his <unk> <unk> . the handwriting corresponded with that of the papers already received ; the <unk> was covered with algebraical <unk> traced in chalk , which they were careful not to <unk> ; and the papers , which consisted for the most part of detached scraps , presented a perfect wilderness of geometrical figures , <unk> sections of every variety being repeated in countless profusion .
" oh , it is you , old <unk> , is it ? what do you want ? can ' t you get anybody to buy your stuffs ? "
" no ; but do , please - do , please , let me in , " <unk> the jew . " i want to speak to his excellency , the governor . "
" news ? what do you mean ? "
chapter iii . the professor ' s experiences
never failing to turn to the best advantage the few intervals when the mist lifted a little , the astronomer would at the same time cast an inquiring glance at the firmament , as he was greatly interested in the revision of the chart of the heavens , in the region <unk> to the constellation <unk> .
" although the orbit of the earth was unaltered , " continued the professor , " the result of the collision was the projection of the comet into a new orbit altogether . "
indulged and loved by all , it was little wonder that young pablo had no longing for the scorching plains of andalusia , or that little nina had lost all wish to return with her pet goat to the barren rocks of sardinia . they had now a home in which they had nothing to desire .
all at once it occurred to the professor that the steelyard would be absolutely useless to him , unless he had the means for ascertaining the precise measurement of the <unk> of the soil of gallia which he proposed to weigh . " something more you must lend me , " he said , addressing the jew . " i must have a measure , and i must have a kilogramme . "
" forty , " said rosette , <unk> .
" let him alone , ben zoof . he will soon come to his senses , " said servadac , quietly .
when the old jew had again recovered himself , the captain addressed him . " now , tell us , what interest do you expect ? "
the professor commenced . " since none of you gentlemen , at the time of the shock , took the precaution to save either a meter measure or a kilogramme weight from the earth , and since both these articles are necessary for the calculation on which we are engaged , i have been obliged to devise means of my own to replace them . "
" and the sum of the specific <unk> of these two substances is 10 , precisely the number that represents gallia ' s density . "
" yes ; a realization of what the illustrious maupertuis has already deemed probable , " replied the astronomer .
the following day was the 1st of august , or , according to rosette , the <unk> of april . in the course of this month gallia would travel 6500 , 000 leagues , attaining at the end a distance of 7000 , 000 leagues from the sun . this would leave 1000 , 000 leagues more to be traversed before reaching the aphelion of the 5 th of january , after which it would begin once more to approach the sun .
now and then the captain and his friends found themselves <unk> whether , in the event of their having to spend another winter upon gallia , some means could not be devised by which the <unk> of a second residence in the recesses of the volcano might be escaped . would not another exploring expedition possibly result in the discovery of a vein of coal or other combustible matter , which could be turned to account in warming some erection which they might hope to put up ? a prolonged existence in their underground quarters was felt to be monotonous and depressing , and although it might be all very well for a man like professor rosette , absorbed in astronomical studies , it was ill suited to the <unk> of any of themselves for any longer period than was absolutely indispensable .
" what , in the name of peace , do you mean ? " <unk> ben zoof , in <unk> amazement .
" he is a <unk> , a thief ! " roared the excited astronomer . " his weights deceive ! "
he was keenly disappointed . looking towards the north , he could distinguish gibraltar faintly visible in the extreme distance , and upon the summit of the rock both ben zoof and himself fancied they could make out another <unk> , giving signals , no doubt , in response to the one here .
" i don ' t want to <unk> , " observed ben zoof , " but i don ' t understand why such learned gentlemen as you cannot make the comet go where you want it to go . "
" leave gallia ! how ? " said count timascheff .
servadac ' s heart sank .
but the professor was in the worst of tempers . generally taciturn and morose , he was more than usually <unk> whenever any one ventured to speak to him . the loss of his telescope had doubtless a great deal to do with his <unk> ; but the captain drew the most favorable conclusions from rosette ' s continued irritation . had the comet been in any way projected from its course , so as to be likely to fail in coming into contact with the earth , the professor would have been quite unable to conceal his satisfaction . but they required to know more than the general truth , and felt that they had no time to lose in getting at the exact details .
" governor-general ! humbug ! " roared rosette . " gallia is my comet ! "
" and pray who told you this ? " again said the professor , with a sneer .
" not too far off for us to come across her orbit at 40 minutes and 30 seconds past two o ' clock on the morning of this coming 1st of january . "
to the great regret of their owners , the two horses and nina ' s pet goat were obliged to be left behind . the only creature for which there was found a place was the carrier-pigeon that had brought the professor ' s message to the hive . servadac thought it might probably be of service in carrying some communication to the earth .
it was agreed between the captain and the count that it would be desirable in every way to maintain the most rigid silence upon the subject of the inexplicable phenomena which had come within their experience . it was to them both a subject of the greatest perplexity to find that the shores of the mediterranean had undergone no change , but they coincided in the opinion that it was prudent to keep their bewilderment entirely to themselves . nothing induced them to break their reserve .
one man alone remained by james starr . this was the overman , simon ford . near him stood a boy , about fifteen years of age , who for some years already had been employed down below .
" decidedly , i have not your legs , my lad , " said the engineer , panting .
" excuse me , sir , " answered the old overman ; " but of course i think so ! if there was good luck in the way harry and i discovered this place , why shouldn ' t the good luck go on ? "
" mr . starr ! mr . starr ! " shouted the overman . " look ! the door is broken open ! "
chapter viii . exploring
" it seems so , " responded one of the fishermen , " unless he has been <unk> by some - "
" i shall find out the spirits as you call them , " said harry , in a tone of firm conviction .
" what can put such a notion in your head , jack ? " asked harry .
" some bird must have got lost among the lower galleries , " replied jack .
harry advanced to the middle of the beam , around which the cord was passed . then his friends began to let him down , and he slowly sank into the pit . as the rope caused him to swing gently round and round , the light of his lamp fell in turns on all points of the side walls , so that he was able to examine them carefully . these walls consisted of pit coal , and so smooth that it would be impossible to ascend them .
the child still breathed , but so very feebly that harry expected it to cease every instant . not a moment was to be lost ; he must carry this poor little creature out of the pit , and take it home to his mother as quickly as he could . he eagerly fastened the cord round his waist , stuck on his lamp , clasped the child to his breast with his left arm , and , keeping his right hand free to hold the knife , he gave the signal agreed on , to have the rope pulled up .
" indeed they could not , " replied the girl ; " if the sun is such as you describe it to me , harry . "
" oh , nothing - nothing . but it used to be very dangerous at that time to go into the new cutting - yes , very dangerous indeed , harry ! once some rash people made their way into these chasms . they got a long , long way ; they were lost ! "
" and there , " cried harry , " they were imprisoned during eight long days ! they were at the point of death , nell ; and , but for a kind and charitable being - an angel perhaps - sent by god to help them , who secretly brought them a little food ; but for a mysterious guide , who afterwards led to them their deliverers , they never would have escaped from that living tomb ! "
" jack , " resumed harry , " i need not pretend that i do not love nell ; i wish above all things to make her my wife . "
" fare ye well . jack ! " returned harry , himself laying hold of the rising ladder ; " mind you say nothing about what i have been telling you . "

it is needless to say that harry and nell were happy . these loving hearts , after the trials they had gone through found in their union the happiness they deserved .
chapter i .
" schwaryencrona ! " cried mr . malarius . " is it possible . - is it really you . - is it the doctor ? "
the doctor then gave him two or three simple questions , but was astonished to hear him answer them , not only in the swedish language , but also in french and english . it was the usual custom of mr . malarius , who contended that it was as easy to learn three languages at once as it was to learn only one .
by this time all feeling of <unk> had passed away , and it seemed as if the doctor had always been a member of the family . they joked and laughed , and were the best of friends in the world , until the old clock of <unk> wood struck ten .
" however , you ought to be able to remember something about it - and doubtless you showed it to mr . malarius , with the rest of the articles - make a little effort , mr . hersebom . was not this name inscribed on the buoy , ' cynthia ' ? "
there was perfect silence for a few minutes .
" speak , child . "
she was going to drive them to the next village , where the doctor would procure another horse and sleigh , and thus procure relays until he reached bergen . this new kind of coachman always astonishes a stranger , but it is the custom in norway and sweden . the men would think it a loss of time to pursue such a calling , and it is not rare to see children of ten or twelve years of age managing heavy equipages with perfect ease .
the sound of voices attracted his attention toward the broad oaken staircase , covered with heavy carpet . he turned , and saw two persons whose costumes appeared to him the height of elegance .
" have i not a right ? "
the next day erik began his new life at school .
" how you must have suffered , when you were shut up in the town , " said the lad to him , <unk> . " you only seem to be in your element when you are on the borders of the fiord or on the open sea . "
" it is what i have always heard , " the other would answer with his calm smile .
such were the bitter reflections of mr . hersebom , while he lay upon his bed of pain ; and he felt still worse when he was able to get up , and occupy his accustomed seat in his arm-chair .
chapter viii .
the next day the advertisement was sent to the <unk> agency in stockholm , and three days afterward it had made its appearance in several newspapers . erik could not repress a sigh and a presentiment that it would be unsuccessful as he read it .
chapter x .
" i know , but before i tell you , i want to ask you what interest you have in finding him ? "
besides , he had another trouble which lay heavy at his heart , and for which he saw no other remedy but absence .
commander marsilas , after a personal examination , was of the same opinion . they found that they were thirty miles from brest , and the order was given to steer for the great french port .

this order appeared to surprise the young lieutenant .
but they were mistaken .
" ship ahoy ! i wish to speak with your captain ! "
tudor brown tried to prevent this . he retreated toward the banks of ice , firing a shot from his cannon every five minutes . but his field of action had now become too limited ; between the ice and the " alaska " he saw that he was lost unless he made a bold attempt to regain the open sea . he attempted this after a few feigned maneuvers to deceive his adversary .
their first thought was that she had been swallowed up by the waters . it was only too natural that they should think this after such an evening as they had just passed .
the occasion was offered by a reporter of one of the principal newspapers of stockholm , who presented himself on board of the " alaska " and solicited the favor of a private interview with the young captain . the object of this intelligent <unk> , let us state briefly , was to extract from his victim the outlines of a biography which would cover one hundred lines . he could not have fallen on a subject more willing to submit to <unk> . erik had been eager to tell the truth , and to proclaim to the world that he did not deserve to be regarded as a second christopher columbus . he therefore related <unk> his story , explaining how he had been picked up at sea by a poor fisherman of noroe , educated by mr . malarius , taken to stockholm by dr . schwaryencrona ; how they had found out that patrick o ' donoghan probably held the key to the mystery that surrounded him . they discovered that he was on board of the " vega ; " they had gone in search of him . he related the accident which had induced them to change their route . erik told all this to convince the world that he was no hero . he told it because he felt ashamed of being so overwhelmed with praises for a performance that only seemed to him natural and right .
the first question they asked each other was , who was tudor brown ? what great interest did he have in preventing patrick o ' donoghan from telling who erik ' s relations were ? the words of that unfortunate man had established one fact , viz . , that tudor brown ' s real name was jones , as it was the only one that the irishman had known him by . now , a mr . noah jones had been associated with erik ' s father in working a petroleum mine , that the young engineer had discovered in pennsylvania . the simple announcement of this fact gave a sinister aspect to many events which had so long appeared mysterious : the suspicious wreck of the " cynthia , " the fall of the infant into the sea , perhaps the death of erik ' s father . a document that mr . durrien found among his papers elucidated many of these perplexing questions .
" did you never suspect that he had had some hand in these successive <unk> ? " asked mr . bredejord .
ardan expressed himself to be quite pleased with the appearance of things in general .
" twenty-six minutes and twenty seconds , " observed captain m ' nicholl , who always aimed at mathematical precision .
" suppose we stood on our heads , like the circus <unk> ! " cried ardan , ready to suit the action to the word .
his companions let him run on while they busied themselves in making their last arrangements , with the greatest coolness and most systematic method . in fact , i don ' t think of anything just now to compare them to except a couple of old travellers who , having to pass the night in the train , are trying to make themselves as comfortable as possible for their long journey . in your profound astonishment , you may naturally ask me of what strange material can the hearts of these americans be made , who can view without the slightest semblance of a <unk> the approach of the most appalling dangers ? in your curiosity i fully participate , but , i ' m sorry to say , i can ' t gratify it . it is one of those things that i could never find out .
" friend ardan , " quietly observed barbican , " my stakes are deposited in the wall street bank , of new york , with orders to pay them over to the captain ' s heirs , in case the captain himself should fail to put in an appearance at the proper time . "
the three brave men united in one last , silent , but warm and <unk> affectionate pressure .
" it ' s simple enough , however , " said barbican .
" wonderful fellows , " murmured the frenchman , smiling with admiration .
" yes , " continued barbican . " captain , you ' re quite right . our initial velocity very fortunately was much greater than what our cambridge friends had calculated for us ! "
" then , dear boy , since they have gone ahead as far as we and even farther , why have not those great selenites tried to start a communication with the earth ? why have they not fired a projectile from the regions lunar to the regions terrestrial ? "
" a high old place for living in ! " cried ardan . " no matter ! i wish we were there now ! wouldn ' t it be jolly , dear boys , to have old mother earth for our moon , to see her always on our sky , never rising , never setting , never undergoing any change except from new earth to last quarter ! would not it be fun to trace the shape of our great oceans and continents , and to say : ' there is the mediterranean ! there is china ! there is the gulf of mexico ! there is the white line of the rocky mountains where old marston is watching for us with his big telescope ! ' then we should see every line , and brightness , and shadow fade away by degrees , as she came nearer and nearer to the sun , until at last she sat completely lost in his dazzling rays ! but - by the way - barbican , are there any eclipses in the moon ? "
" it might , friend michael , but an <unk> by such means is not very likely . "
" what ' s the matter ? " asked barbican quickly , as he looked up and saw the frenchman pointing to something outside the projectile .
" answer it yourself , barbican ! you know more about the moon than i do ! you know more about it than all the <unk> that ever lived ! "
the neutral point .
1 . suppose the projectile to possess velocity enough to pass the neutral point . in such case , it would undoubtedly proceed onward to the moon , being drawn thither by lunar attraction .
" it would be worth a trial ! " cried ardan , so full of his subject as not to notice the captain ' s <unk> tone ; " attraction once destroyed , there is an end forever to all loads , packs and burdens ! how the poor <unk> horses would rejoice ! adieu forever to all cranes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and even <unk> ! we could dispense with all ladders , door steps , and even <unk> ! "
" my opinion is , " answered the captain , " that the projectile was not aimed true . every possible precaution had been taken , i am well aware , but we all know that an inch , a line , even the tenth part of a hair ' s breadth wrong at the start would have sent us thousands of miles off our course by this time . "
to the north , in the direction of mare frigoris , extends mare imbrium , the sea of rains , its central point in 30° north and 20° east . it is somewhat circular in shape , and it covers a space of about 300 thousand square miles . south of oceanus procellarum and separated from mare nubium by a goodly number of ring mountains , lies the little basin of mare humorum , the sea of humors , containing only about 60 thousand square miles , its central point having a latitude of 20° south and a longitude of 40° east .
" my theory , " said barbican , " is pretty much the same as that lately presented by an english astronomer , nasmyth , who has devoted much study and reflection to lunar matters . of course , i only <unk> my theory , i don ' t affirm it . these streaks are cracks , made in the moon ' s surface by cooling or by <unk> , through which volcanic matter has been forced up by internal pressure . the sinking ice of a frozen lake , when meeting with some sharp pointed rock , cracks in a radiating manner : every one of its fissures then <unk> the water , which immediately <unk> <unk> over the ice pretty much as the lava <unk> itself over the lunar surface . this theory accounts for the radiating nature of the streaks , their great and nearly equal thickness , their immense length , their <unk> to cast a shadow , and their <unk> at any time except at or near the full moon . still it is nothing but a theory , and i don ' t deny that serious objections may be brought against it . "
at half past two in the morning of december 6 th , the travellers crossed the 0 th northern parallel , at a distance from the lunar surface of 600 miles , reduced to about 6 by their spy-glasses . barbican could not yet see the least probability of their landing at any point of the disc . the velocity of the projectile was decidedly slow , but for that reason extremely puzzling . barbican could not account for it . at such a proximity to the moon , the velocity , one would think , should be very great indeed to be able to counteract the lunar attraction . why did it not fall ? barbican could not tell ; his companions were equally in the dark . ardan said he gave it up . besides they had no time to spend in investigating it . the lunar panorama was unrolling all its splendors beneath them , and they could not bear to lose one of its slightest details .
" salve , mt . barbican ! " then cried both gentlemen , rising and taking off their hats respectfully to the distant peak .
" look to the west ! " interrupted barbican , watching , as usual , while his companions were talking , and probably perfectly unconscious of what they were saying ; " directly to the west ! now tell me what you see ! "
at the eightieth degree , when the projectile was hardly 100 miles distant from the moon , the aspect of things underwent no improvement . on the contrary , the nearer the travellers approached the lunar surface , the <unk> , the more inhospitable , and the more unearthly , everything seem to look . still when five o ' clock in the morning brought our travellers to within 50 miles of mount <unk> - which their spy-glasses rendered as visible as if it was only about half a mile off , ardan could not control himself .
" and what are you going to do with the ruler , m ' nicholl ! "
" there i agree with you , ardan , " observed the captain . " that would be just the time to start . the moon herself , i grant , would be lost in the solar rays and therefore invisible all the time of our trip , but in compensation , we should have the full earth in full view . besides - and this is your chief point , no doubt , ardan - if we should happen to be drawn round the moon , just as we are at the present moment , we should enjoy the inestimable advantage of beholding her invisible side magnificently illuminated ! "
there was now , however , nothing to be heard , and very little more to be seen . the few <unk> that flashed over the sky , gradually became fewer and dimmer ; the asteroids sought paths further and further apart , and finally disappeared altogether . the ether resumed its original blackness . the stars , eclipsed for a moment , blazed out again on the firmament , and the invisible disc , that had flashed into view for an instant , once more relapsed forever into the impenetrable depths of night .
[illustration : once more the pipes of an <unk> . ]
a little to their left , the travellers could now plainly distinguish one of the most remarkable of the moon ' s craters , newton , so well known to all lunar astronomers . its ramparts , forming a perfect circle , rise to such a height , at least 2000 feet , as to seem insurmountable .
at last , in the very centre of this <unk> region , right too at its very culmination , the travellers came on the brightest and most remarkable mountain of the moon . in the dazzling tycho they found it an easy matter to recognize the famous lunar point , which the world will for ever designate by the name of the distinguished astronomer of denmark .
" precisely , " said barbican : " life without movement , and no life at all , are equivalent expressions . "
" what can we throw overboard ? we have no ballast like <unk> . "
it was a resource he had often fallen back on in difficult <unk> . nor did it fail him now .
" no sleep now ! " exclaimed ardan .
" we are falling ! " he shrieked <unk> .
" i must agree with you of course , mr . midshipman , " replied brownson with a slight smile ; " i have no grounds whatever for contradicting you . "
" san francisco ! "
" no luck ! "
" call mr . marston on deck at once ! " cried the captain , his voice betraying unwonted excitement as he put the glass again to his eye .
obeying orders instantly and with the <unk> ' d , <unk> enthusiasm of his nature , he threw himself at once heart and soul into the great enterprise . though possessing no official prominence - this he absolutely <unk> upon - he is well known to be the great fountain head whence <unk> all the life , order , dispatch , simplicity , economy , and wonderful harmony which , so far , have so eminently characterized the magnificent project . with all operations for raising the necessary funds - further than by giving some sound practical advice - he positively refused to connect himself ( this may be the reason why subscriptions to the <unk> stock are so slow in coming in ) , but in the proper <unk> of expenses and the strict surveillance of the mechanical , engineering , and architectural departments , his services have proved invaluable . his experience in the vast operations at stony hill has given him great skill in the difficult art of managing men . his voice is seldom heard at the meetings , but when it is , people seem to take a pleasure in readily submitting to its <unk> .

" have you ever heard of a vessel surviving such circumstances ? " i asked .
carrying <unk> and <unk> , the chancellor during the last four-and-twenty hours has held a steady course . m . letourneur is the only one of all the passengers who has remarked the change of tack ; curtis , however , has set all speculation on his part at rest by telling him that he wanted to get ahead of the wind , and that he was tacking to the west to catch a favorable current .

the fire continued to progress even more rapidly than we had hitherto suspected . the heat gradually drove the passengers nearly all on deck , and the two stern cabins , lighted , as i said , by their windows in the <unk> were the only quarters below that were inhabitable . of these mrs . kear occupied one , and curtis reserved the other for ruby , who , a raving <unk> , had to be kept rigidly under restraint . i went down occasionally to see him , but invariably found him in a state of <unk> terror , uttering horrible shrieks , as though possessed with the idea that he was being scorched by the most <unk> heat .
while he had still the remaining chance , curtis rescued from the store-room such few provisions as the heat of the compartment allowed him to obtain ; and a lot of cases of salt meat and biscuits , a cask of brandy , some barrels of fresh water , together with some sails and wraps , a compass and other instruments are now lying packed in a mass all ready for prompt removal to the boats whenever we shall be obliged to leave the ship .
" touch the tackling of the <unk> , one of you ; only touch it , and i ' ll cleave your skull . "
in another hour the mists had totally disappeared , and it was broad daylight . i and m . letourneur stood watching curtis as he continued eagerly to <unk> the western horizon . astonishment was written on his countenance ; to him it appeared perfectly incredible that , after our course for so long had been due south from the bermudas , no land should be in sight . but not a speck , however minute , broke the <unk> line that joined sea and sky . after a time curtis made his way along the netting to the shrouds , and swung himself quickly up to the top of the mainmast . for several minutes he remained there examining the open space around , then seizing one of the <unk> he glided down and rejoined us on the poop .
andre took a <unk> from his pocket , and proceeded to make a drawing of the reef . scarcely had he completed the outline when his father exclaimed :
on the 8 th the unlading of the ship commenced . pulleys and tackling were put over the hatches , and passengers and crew together proceeded to haul up the heavy bales which had been deluged so frequently by water that the cotton was all but spoiled . one by one the <unk> bales were placed in the boat to be transported to the reef . after the first layer of cotton had been removed it became necessary to drain off part of the water that filled the hold . for this purpose the leak in the side had somehow or other to be stopped , and this was an operation which was cleverly accomplished by dowlas and flaypole , who contrived to dive at low tide and nail a sheet of copper over the entire hole . this , however , of itself would have been utterly inadequate to sustain the pressure that would arise from the action of the pumps ; so curtis ordered that a number of the bales should be piled up inside against the broken planks . the scheme succeeded very well , and as the water got lower and lower in the hold the men were enabled to resume their task of unlading .
curtis thinks it quite probable that the leaks may be mended from the interior . by far the best way of repairing the damage would be to <unk> the ship , and to shift the planking , but the appliances are wanting for such an undertaking ; moreover , any bad weather which might occur while the ship was on her flank would only too certainly be fatal to her altogether . but the captain has very little doubt that by some device or other he shall manage to patch up the hole in such a way as will insure our reaching land in safety .
toward two o ' clock in the morning i was myself preparing to go to my cabin , when burke , one of the sailors who had been down into the hold , came on deck with the cry :
curtis descended to his cabin , and almost immediately returned with a loaded revolver in his hand .
i was quite mistaken as to his object . mr . kear had no intention of looking after his wife , but remained by the side of silas huntly until the gathering darkness hid them both from view .
" and water , too , " added miss herbey , " the water of which we are so seriously in need . "
" the strongest constitutions suffer the most , do they not ? " she said .
had every spark of humanity died out of my breast , that i thus brought the girl face to face with the terrible truth , without a word of hope or comfort ? the eyes of andre and his father , dilated with hunger , were fixed upon me , and i saw reproach and astonishment written in their faces .
the young man clutched at it eagerly .

but no ; very soon large heavy drops began to fall , and the <unk> , passing over our heads , was <unk> its contents upon us . the shower , however , was very transient ; already a bright streak of light along the horizon marked the limit of the cloud and warned us that we must be quick to make the most of what it had to give us . curtis had placed the broken barrel in the position that was most exposed , and every sail was spread out to the <unk> extent our dimensions would allow .

after a time i fell into a restless , dreamy <unk> . i was neither asleep nor awake . how long i remained in that state of stupor i could hardly say , but at length a strange sensation brought me to myself . was i dreaming , or was there not really some unaccustomed odor floating in the air ? my nostrils became distended , and i could scarcely suppress a cry of astonishment ; but some instinct kept me quiet , and i laid myself down again with the puzzled sensation sometimes experienced when we have forgotten a word or name . only a few minutes , however , had elapsed before another still more savory puff induced me to take several long <unk> . suddenly , the truth seemed to flash across my mind . " surely , " i muttered to myself , " this must be cooked meat that i can smell . "
" fields , fields , gardens and trees ! look , there ' s an inn under the trees ! quick , quick ! brandy , gin , water ! a guinea a drop ! i ' ll pay for it ! i ' ve lots of money ! lots ! lots ! "
his voice was choked with tears , and he could not finish his sentence .
the <unk> of the court , was , besides , well seconded in his arduous and delicate duties . the <unk> and their <unk> , the <unk> and other officers of the palace , presided personally in the arrangement of the dances . the grand <unk> , covered with diamonds , the <unk> in their most exquisite costumes , set the example to the wives of the military and civil dignitaries of the ancient " city of white stone . " when , therefore , the signal for the " <unk> " resounded through the saloons , and the guests of all ranks took part in that measured promenade , which on occasions of this kind has all the importance of a national dance , the mingled costumes , the sweeping robes adorned with lace , and uniforms covered with orders , presented a scene of dazzling splendor , lighted by hundreds of <unk> multiplied tenfold by the numerous mirrors <unk> the walls .
" none , " replied general kissoff . " the head of the police cannot state whether or not he has crossed the frontier . "
" he knows that , " answered the czar ; " but what he does not know is , that ivan ogareff , as well as being a rebel , is also playing the part of a traitor , and that in him he has a personal and bitter enemy . it is to the grand duke that ogareff owes his first disgrace ; and what is more serious is , that this man is not known to him . ogareff ' s plan , therefore , is to go to irkutsk , and , under an assumed name , offer his services to the grand duke . then , after gaining his confidence , when the tartars have invested irkutsk , he will betray the town , and with it my brother , whose life he seeks . this is what i have learned from my secret intelligence ; this is what the grand duke does not know ; and this is what he must know ! "
omsk is the center of that military organization of western siberia which is intended to <unk> the kirghiz population . here are the bounds , more than once <unk> by the <unk> nomads , and there was every reason to believe that omsk was already in danger . the line of military stations , that is to say , those cossack posts which are ranged in <unk> from omsk to semipolatinsk , must have been broken in several places . now , it was to be feared that the " grand <unk> , " who govern the kirghiz districts would either voluntarily accept , or involuntarily submit to , the dominion of tartars , mussulmen like themselves , and that to the hate caused by slavery was not united the hate due to the <unk> of the greek and mussulman religions . for some time , indeed , the tartars of turkestan had endeavored , both by force and persuasion , to subdue the kirghiz hordes .
in short , if anyone could accomplish this journey from moscow to irkutsk , across a rebellious country , surmount obstacles , and brave perils of all sorts , michael strogoff was the man .
michael strogoff , however , had neither cannon , nor horsemen , nor foot-soldiers , nor beasts of burden . he would travel in a carriage or on horseback , when he could ; on foot , when he could not .
if in this compartment the subject of conversation varied but little - nor did it , indeed , in the other carriages of the train - in all it might have been observed that the <unk> used much <unk> . when they did happen to venture out of the region of facts , they never went so far as to attempt to divine the intentions of the muscovite government , or even to <unk> them .
in the avenues and long alleys there was already a large assemblage of people - the sun , which had risen at four o ' clock , being well above the horizon - an extraordinary mixture of europeans and asiatics , talking , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . everything which can be bought or sold seemed to be heaped up in this square . furs , precious stones , silks , cashmere shawls , turkey carpets , weapons from the caucasus , <unk> from <unk> and ispahan . tiflis armor , caravan <unk> . european <unk> , swiss clocks , <unk> and silks from lyons , english <unk> , harness , fruits , vegetables , minerals from the ural , <unk> , <unk> , spices , perfumes , medicinal herbs , wood , tar , rope , horn , pumpkins , <unk> , etc - all the products of india , china , persia , from the shores of the caspian and the black sea , from america and europe , were united at this corner of the globe .
" sister , " repeated michael strogoff , " we are authorized to continue our journey to irkutsk . will you come with me ? "
" we shall see that , when we are at the seat of war ; but till then , why , let us be traveling companions . later , we shall have both time and occasion to be rivals . "
" i will try and match that ! "
" you sent a dispatch to your cousin ? "
chapter ix day and night in a tarantass
" what matter ! winter is the friend of russia . "
" however , you have returned , brother , " said nadia .
on arriving that evening michael instinctively asked the postmaster how many hours ago the carriage which preceded them had passed that stage .
" in siberia , " replied michael , " we are obliged to do a little of everything . "
however , nadia ' s thoughts sometimes left the provinces of lake baikal , and returned to her present situation . her father ' s image faded away , and was replaced by that of her generous companion as he first appeared on the <unk> railroad . she recalled his attentions during that journey , his arrival at the <unk> , the hearty simplicity with which he had called her sister , his kindness to her in the descent of the volga , and then all that he did for her on that terrible night of the storm in the urals , when he saved her life at the peril of his own .
it need scarcely be said that blount did not trouble himself about the girl at table . that gentleman was not in the habit of doing two things at once . she was also one of the few subjects of conversation which he did not care to discuss with his companion .
as the two correspondents intended to stop at ichim , they had not to trouble themselves to find transport , and had their carriage put away . in ten minutes michael was told that his tarantass was ready to start .
" very well , they shall belong to whichever of us is able to start . defend yourself ; i shall not spare you ! "
michael fixed his piercing gaze upon the siberian , but the other did not quail before it .
michael recognized the tartar <unk> , which is usually answered by lying flat on the ground . as neither he nor the boatmen obeyed a volley was let fly , and two of the horses were mortally wounded .
feofar ' s camp presented a magnificent spectacle .
" he will come . he will not fail to do that . he must join the emir . siberia is cut in two now , and very certainly feofar ' s army is only waiting for him to advance on irkutsk . "
" it is approaching , sangarre . "
" you are so , gentlemen , " answered ogareff ; " i am curious to read your articles in the daily telegraph . "
" duty , indeed , imperious duty , " said the old siberian , " of those who sacrifice everything , even the joy of giving a kiss , perhaps the last , to his old mother . all that you do not know , nadia - all that i did not know myself - i now know . you have made me understand everything . but the light which you have thrown on the mysteries of my heart , i cannot return on yours . since my son has not told you his secret , i must keep it . forgive me , nadia ; i can never repay what you have done for me . "
a tartar soldier bearing this terrible instrument of torture approached marfa . the knout is composed of a certain number of leathern <unk> , at the end of which are attached pieces of twisted iron wire . it is reckoned that a sentence to one hundred and twenty blows of this whip is equivalent to a sentence of death .

a trumpet call was heard . this was the signal for the amusements to begin . " here comes the ballet , " said alcide to blount ; " but , contrary to our customs , these barbarians give it before the drama . "
" blind ! " repeated the young man , much moved .
" no . . . it is not right . . . " answered michael , who wished to remain unmoved .
" do not reproach yourself , friend , " replied michael , pressing his hand over his eyes . " with you for a guide i can still act . take a few hours ' repose . nadia must rest too . to-morrow we will recommence our journey ! "
" do you see a boat ? " asked michael .
" save one , " said michael , " but empty the others . "
a dozen horsemen dashed forward , and the kibitka was surrounded . before they knew where they were , michael , nadia , and nicholas were prisoners , and were being dragged rapidly towards nijni-oudinsk .
the tartars were not long in perceiving that one of their prisoners was blind , and their natural barbarity led them to make game of their unfortunate victim . they were traveling fast . michael ' s horse , having no one to guide him , often started aside , and so made confusion among the ranks . this drew on his rider such abuse and brutality as wrung nadia ' s heart , and filled nicholas with indignation . but what could they do ? they could not speak the tartar language , and their assistance was mercilessly refused . soon it occurred to these men , in a refinement of cruelty , to exchange the horse michael was riding for one which was blind . the motive of the change was explained by a remark which michael overheard , " perhaps that russian can see , after all ! "
however , michael guessed it . " you are quite done up , poor child , " he said sometimes .
soon , the body of nicholas , the hands crossed on the breast , was laid in the grave . michael and nadia , kneeling , prayed a last time for the poor fellow , inoffensive and good , who had paid for his devotion towards them with his life .
all this time the pilgrims were repeating their prayers aloud , and the old boatman , <unk> away the blocks of ice which pressed too near them , imperturbably steered the raft in the middle of the rapid current of the angara .
the grand duke went up to him . " you are a courier from the czar ? " he asked .
" we will <unk> him , thanks to you , who know him , and i will make him die under the knout . go ! "
two o ' clock struck . now was the time to cause the diversion agreed upon with the tartars , waiting for the assault . ivan ogareff opened the window and stationed himself at the north angle of the side terrace .
below him flowed the roaring waters of the angara . ogareff took a match from his pocket , struck it and lighted a small bunch of tow , impregnated with <unk> powder , which he threw into the river .
this had been done that night , a few hours previously , and this was the reason that the raft which carried the true courier of the czar , nadia , and the fugitives , floated on a current of mineral oil . through the breaches in these reservoirs of enormous dimensions rushed the naphtha in torrents , and , following the inclination of the ground , it spread over the surface of the river , where its density allowed it to float . this was the way ivan ogareff carried on warfare ! allied with tartars , he acted like a tartar , and against his own countrymen !
swimming beneath the water , michael managed to get a footing with nadia on the quay . michael strogoff had reached his journey ' s end ! he was in irkutsk !
my uncle looked keenly at the document for some moments and then declared that it was runic . the letters were similar to those in the book , but then what did they mean ? this was exactly what i wanted to know .
we start on the journey
in the first instance we crossed some narrow streets , where we met numerous groups of galley slaves , with <unk> trousers , grey and yellow , working under the orders and the sticks of severe <unk> , and finally reached the <unk> ' <unk> .
a few minutes afterwards , the schooner started before the wind , under all the canvas she could carry , and entered the channel . an hour later , the capital of denmark seemed to sink into the waves , and we were at no great distance from the coast of <unk> . my uncle was delighted ; for myself , <unk> and dissatisfied , i appeared almost to expect a glimpse of the ghost of hamlet .
everything in this man ' s manner revealed a calm and phlegmatic temperament . there was nothing indolent about him , but his appearance spoke of tranquillity . he was one of those who never seemed to expect anything from anybody , who liked to work when he thought proper , and whose philosophy nothing could astonish or trouble .
after the basaltic eruption was appeased and set at rest , the volcano , the force of which increased with that of the extinct craters , gave free passage to the fiery overflow of lava , and to the mass of cinders and <unk> stone , now scattered over the sides of the mountain , like <unk> hair on the shoulders of a <unk> .
the undulation of these infinite numbers of mountains , whose snowy summits make them look as if covered by foam , recalled to my remembrance the surface of a <unk> ocean . if i looked towards the west , the ocean lay before me in all its majestic grandeur , a continuation as it were , of these fleecy <unk> .
" arne saknussemm ! " cried my uncle , " now , <unk> , do you begin to have faith ? "
" why , " said the professor hotly , " one would say you were already beginning to be afraid . how will you get on presently ? do you know , that as yet , we have not penetrated one inch into the bowels of the earth . "
" upwards , " cried my uncle , shrugging his shoulders , " how can that be ? "
i accordingly lost no opportunity of searching , and had not gone more than about a hundred yards , when the evidence i sought for <unk> up in the most incontestable manner before my eyes . it was quite natural that i should expect to find these signs , for during the <unk> period the seas contained no fewer than fifteen hundred different animal and vegetable species . my feet , so long accustomed to the hard and arid lava soil , suddenly found themselves treading on a kind of soft dust , the remains of plants and shells .
under the ocean
where was i going ? it was impossible to say . i was perfectly ignorant of the matter .
i thought the remark ungrateful , and felt almost inclined to say so ; but i forbore .
in truth , i was simply in the presence of a very ordinary product of the earth , of singular and gigantic proportions . my uncle unhesitatingly called them by their real names .
" why , that the needle instead of dipping towards the pole as it does on earth , in the northern hemisphere , has an upward tendency . "
" science , great , mighty and in the end unerring , " replied my uncle dogmatically , " science has fallen into many errors - errors which have been fortunate and useful rather than otherwise , for they have been the <unk> to truth . "
" what - what is the matter ? " i said at last , coming to myself .
what , then , could be the matter ? after one or two preliminary <unk> , i determined to inquire .
of course i was at a loss to understand . i turned round towards my uncle , absorbed in gloomy reflections . i had little wish to disturb him from his reverie . i accordingly turned once more towards our worthy icelander .
hans was quite right . the two monsters only , disturbed the surface of the sea !
the other was the mighty <unk> , a serpent with a cylindrical trunk , with a short <unk> tail , with fins like a bank of oars in a roman galley .
" i think so , " i replied .
about twelve o ' clock the storm became worse than ever . we are obliged now to fasten every bit of cargo tightly on the deck of the raft , or everything would be swept away . we make ourselves fast , too , each man lashing the other . the waves drive over us , so that several times we are actually under water .
" one will suffice . how about getting back ? " i asked .
" but what are we to do for food ? " i asked .
" let us see to the commissariat department " , replied my uncle gravely .
lofty <unk> of early remains rose at intervals . they undulated away to the limits of the distant horizon and were lost in a thick and brown fog .
discovery upon discovery
" yes , " he continued , with renewed animation , " this is a fossil man , a contemporary of the <unk> , with the bones of which this whole <unk> is covered . but if i am called on to explain how he came to this place , how these various strata by which he is covered have fallen into this vast cavity , i can undertake to give you no explanation . doubtless , if we carry ourselves back to the quaternary epoch , we shall find that great and mighty convulsions took place in the crust of the earth ; the continually cooling operation , through which the earth had to pass , produced fissures , landslips , and chasms , through which a large portion of the earth made its way . i come to no absolute conclusion , but there is the man , surrounded by the works of his hands , his hatchets and his carved flints , which belong to the stony period ; and the only rational supposition is , that , like myself , he visited the centre of the earth as a traveling tourist , a pioneer of science . at all events , there can be no doubt of his great age , and of his being one of the oldest race of human beings . "
that wondrous dream , when i saw the <unk> times <unk> , when the tertiary and quaternary periods passed before me , was now realized !
now that i think of the matter calmly , and that i reflect upon it <unk> ; now that months , years , have passed since this strange and unnatural adventure befell us - what am i to think , what am i to believe ?

" yes , my boy , i am quite as eager to do so as you can be . but , in the first place , let us examine this mysterious gallery , in order to find if we shall need to prepare and mend our ladders . "
the professor , who was looking on , held his chronometer in his hand .
i hastened to put the light to the wick , which crackled and sparkled , hissing and spitting like a serpent ; then , running as fast as i could , i returned to the shore .
it was a moment of palpitating interest , of deep anxiety . my uncle , the professor , never took his eyes off the chronometer .
but what ?
he glared wildly about , seeking something - doubtless myself . i gave myself up for lost . no hope of safety or escape seemed to remain .
an hour passed away , and except that there was a slight increase in the temperature no incident modified the situation .
" make up our minds to what ? " i asked , in considerable surprise .
what a nerve ! the man placed in a position like that we occupied must have been very brave to speak like this .
my uncle , the professor , ate greedily , but evidently without appetite , eating simply from some mechanical motion . i put the food inside my lips , and hungry as i was , chewed my morsel without pleasure , and without satisfaction .
it took some minutes for myself and my uncle to form a decided opinion on the subject . the worthy professor swallowed about half a pint and did not seem able to drink any more .
and yet all the while certain , and as it were , involuntary observations determined my convictions . by the doubtful glare of the torch , i could make out some singular changes in the granitic strata ; a strange and terrible phenomenon was about to be produced , in which electricity played a part .
when i opened my eyes i felt the hand of the guide clutching me firmly by the belt . with his other hand he supported my uncle . i was not grievously wounded , but bruised all over in the most remarkable manner .
" look , look , my boy , " said the professor , as dogmatically as usual .
" perhaps she is simply sailing , " observed pencroft . " the wind is favourable for the direction which she appears to be taking , and she may be anxious to economise her coal , being so far from land . "
" in half an hour we shall be certain about that , " answered the reporter . " besides , it is very evident that the intention of the captain of this ship is to land , and , consequently , if not to-day , to-morrow at the latest , we shall make his acquaintance . "
" you mistrust me ! " said ayrton quickly .
ayrton drew back . in the rapid flash of the lantern , he had recognised his former accomplice , bob harvey , who could not have known him , as he must have thought ayrton long since dead .
but ayrton , without replying , <unk> himself from his grasp and attempted to rush into the magazine . a shot fired into the midst of the <unk> , and all would be over !
however , one chance yet remained ; it was that bob harvey , after all , would not venture his ship into the channel , and that he would keep outside the islet . he would be still separated from the coast by half a mile , and at that distance his shot could not be very destructive .
at any rate , the settlers saw at once , with extreme satisfaction , that the brig possessed a very varied cargo - an assortment of all sorts of articles , utensils , manufactured goods , and tools - such as the ships which make the great <unk> of polynesia are usually laden with . it was probable that they would find a little of everything , and they agreed that it was exactly what was necessary for the colony of lincoln island .
there was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of granite . many natural excavations situated in the upper passage were enlarged either by <unk> or mine , and granite house thus became a general warehouse , containing all the provisions , arms , tools , and spare utensils - in a word , all the stores of the colony .
" neb , top ! neb ! " repeated the engineer , again pointing in the direction of granite house .

it was the 9 th of november , seven o ' clock in the evening . the three settlers were talking in herbert ' s room , when they heard top utter quick barks .
cyrus harding was not mistaken . at jup ' s neck hung a small bag , and in this bag was found a little note traced by neb ' s hand .

" but the willow bark ? "
" we shall have a warm day of it , " said the reporter , laughing .
but , at that moment , top , breaking loose , began to bark furiously and rush to the back of the corral , to the right of the house .
the day after his arrival at the corral , on the 0 th of last november , at nightfall , he was surprised by the convicts , who had scaled the palisade . they bound and gagged him ; then he was led to a dark cavern , at the foot of mount franklin , where the convicts had taken refuge .
" no , " answered ayrton . " the convicts discovered her in her little harbour only eight days ago , they put to sea in her , and - "
it was now time to think of returning , for these researches could not be prolonged indefinitely . the colonists were certainly right in believing that the mysterious being did not reside on the surface of the island , and the wildest fancies haunted their excited imaginations . pencroft and neb , particularly , were not contented with the mystery , but allowed their imaginations to wander into the domain of the supernatural .
" at last ! " exclaimed harding .
" he ! " said harding .
" the nautilus ? " said the captain , with a faint smile .
captain nemo was compelled , therefore , to remain . he observed these men thrown without resources upon a desert island , but had no wish to be himself discovered by them . by degrees he became interested in their efforts when he saw them honest , energetic , and bound to each other by the ties of friendship . as if despite his wishes , he penetrated all the secrets of their existence . by means of the diving-dress he could easily reach the well in the interior of granite house , and climbing by the projections of rock to its upper orifice he heard the colonists as they recounted the past , and studied the present and future . he learnt from them the tremendous conflict of america with america itself , for the abolition of slavery . yes , these men were worthy to reconcile captain nemo with that humanity which they represented so nobly in the island .
captain nemo had saved cyrus harding . it was he also who had brought back the dog to the chimneys , who rescued top from the waters of the lake , who caused to fall at flotsam point the case containing so many things useful to the colonists , who conveyed the canoe back into the stream of the mercy , who cast the cord from the top of granite house at the time of the attack by the <unk> , who made known the presence of ayrton upon tabor island , by means of the document enclosed in the bottle , who caused the explosion of the brig by the shock of a torpedo placed at the bottom of the canal , who saved herbert from a certain death by bringing the sulphate of quinine ; and finally , it was he who had killed the convicts with the electric balls , of which he possessed the secret , and which he employed in the chase of submarine creatures . thus were explained so many apparently supernatural occurrences , and which all proved the generosity and power of the captain .
reflections of the colonists - their labours of <unk> resumed - the 1st of january 1800 - a cloud over the summit of the volcano - first warnings of an eruption - ayrton and cyrus harding at the corral - exploration of the dakkar grotto - what captain nemo had confided to the engineer .
the end of the year 1800 found them occupied by these important labours , to the exclusion of almost all others . at the expiration of two months and a half the ribs had been set up and the first planks adjusted . it was already evident that the plans made by cyrus harding were admirable , and that the vessel would behave well at sea .
" true , " replied cyrus harding , " and i do not fear an earthquake in the sense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions of the soil provoked by the expansion of subterranean gases . but other causes may produce great disasters . "
" well ? " said pencroft , his brow suddenly contracting .
an hour afterwards the boiling lava filled the corral , converting into vapour the water of the little rivulet which ran through it , burning up the house like dry grass , and leaving not even a post of the palisade to mark the spot where the corral once stood .
" ah , what a misfortune ! what a misfortune ! " often repeated pencroft . " if we had but a <unk> to take us to tabor island ! but we have nothing , nothing ! "
no ! no hope of being saved could be retained , and a horrible death , death from hunger and thirst , awaited them upon this rock .
<unk> .
an unexpected letter
" p . s . - on the 5 th of february next you will receive a large danish dog , with hanging lips , and tawny coat with black stripes . you will take it on board and have it fed with <unk> bread , mixed with tallow grease . you will acknowledge the reception of the said dog to me under the same initials as above , <unk> <unk> , leghorn , italy .

" you don ' t give me time to speak . tell me , if you please , doctor , how it comes that you are to take part in the expedition of the forward . "
" he was , that ' s certain , but he isn ' t now , " said johnson , pointing to the deserted deck .
" yes , " answered the latter , " and it ' s a great pity , for you may be right , mr . clawbonny . "
the doctor had not yet begun to wear the garments he destined for the arctic seas , but he had donned a sailor ' s dress like the rest ; he was a queer sight with his <unk> , in which his legs disappeared , his vast <unk> hat , his jacket and trousers of the same ; when drenched with heavy rains or enormous waves the doctor looked like a sort of <unk> , and was proud of the comparison .
it was about the year 900 that some navigators left iceland and discovered greenland . sebastian cabot forced his way as far as latitude 50 degrees in 1400 . gaspard and michel <unk> , in 1500 and 1500 , went as far north as 60 degrees ; and martin frobisher , in 1500 , arrived as far as the bay that bears his name . to john davis belongs the honour of having discovered the straits in 1500 ; and two years later , in a third voyage , that bold navigator and great whaler reached the <unk> parallel , twenty-seven degrees from the pole .

chapter vii
" yes , a little ; but since we got into the straits they have begun to talk about the fantastic captain ; more than one of them expected to see him appear at the extremity of greenland ; but between you and me , doctor , doesn ' t it astonish you a little too ? "
" suppose he should wish to attempt some superhuman enterprise , and to penetrate where others have never been able to reach , do you believe if the crew knew it they would ever have enlisted ? as it is , having got so far , going farther becomes a necessity . "
" i am of your opinion , johnson , but the difficulty will be to get as far as melville bay . see how the icebergs encircle us from every point ! they scarcely leave a passage for the forward . just examine that immense plain over there . "
" it seems to me , " said the doctor , " that the temperature has a tendency to get lower . "
at three o ' clock in the afternoon the forward had attained thin de <unk> , <unk> mountain ; the sea was very rough ; from time to time a vast and inopportune fog fell from the grey sky ; however , at noon an exact observation could be taken . the vessel was in 60 degrees 20 minutes latitude by 50 degrees 20 minutes longitude . it was necessary to attain two degrees more in order to meet with freer and more favourable navigation .
" as it may please god , " replied the boatswain .
" well , mr . clawbonny , " said johnson , " can you explain to me the cause of that phenomenon ? "
" is that all ? " cried the doctor .
chilly cape was doubled during the night under the influence of a favourable wind , and soon the high mountains of disko rose in the horizon . <unk> bay , the residence of the governor-general of the danish settlements , was left to the right . shandon did not consider it worth while to stop , and soon <unk> the esquimaux pirogues who were endeavouring to reach his ship .
" to tell you the truth , it would be a dreary winter , " said plover , " for the ship is exposed from every quarter . "
" ah ! you mean the dog , " said plover .
" good god ! " cried simpson , drawing back with fright .
shandon advanced towards the mutineers ; at the same time the mate came up and said in a whisper : " commander , if you wish to get out of here we haven ' t a minute to lose ; there ' s an iceberg drifting up the pass , and it is very likely to cork up all issue and keep us prisoners . "
the latter was at the helm ; the brig , driven along by her screw , which turned in the foaming waves , dashed into the middle of the then opened pass ; it was time , for scarcely had the forward cleared the opening than her prison closed up again behind her . it was a thrilling moment , and on board there was only one stout and undisturbed heart - that of the captain . the crew , astonished at the manoeuvre , cried out :

the captain , followed by the doctor , johnson , and his dog dick , immediately leaped upon the ice , and soon reached land . dick leaped with joy , for since he had recognised the captain he had become more sociable , keeping his grudge against certain men of the crew for whom his master had no more friendship than he . the port was not then blocked up with ice that the east winds generally heaped up there ; the earth , intersected with peaks , offered at their summits graceful undulations of snow . the house and lantern erected by james ross were still in a tolerable state of preservation ; but the provisions seemed to have been ransacked by foxes and bears , the recent traces of which were easily distinguished . men , too , had had something to do with the devastation , for a few remains of esquimaux huts remained upon the shores of the bay . the six graves <unk> the remains of the six sailors of the enterprise and the investigator were recognisable by a slight swelling of the ground ; they had been respected both by men and animals . in placing his foot for the first time on boreal land , the doctor experienced much emotion . it is impossible to imagine the feelings with which the heart is assailed at the sight of the remains of houses , tents , huts , and magazines that nature so marvellously preserves in those cold countries .
the forward rushed along under the pressure of her engines , the smoke from which twisted round the shining points of the icebergs ; the weather was constantly changing from dry cold to snowy fogs . the brig , which drew little water , sailed along the west coast ; hatteras did not wish to miss the entrance to bellot strait , as the only outlet to the gulf of boothia on the south was the strait , only partially known to the fury and the hecla ; if he missed the bellot strait , he might be shut up without possibility of egress .
" he ' s right , " said the doctor ; " we are here in a sort of <unk> , with scarcely enough space for working the brig , and if we are forced to winter in the strait ! . . . well , we shan ' t be the first that have had to do it , and they got over it , and so shall we . "
chapter xviii
" yes , sir ; the admiralty sent us here in 1800 , under the command of captain inglefield , with the steamer phoenix and a transport ship , the <unk> , loaded with provisions ; we brought enough with us to revictual a whole expedition . "
this stone , on a forlorn coast of these far-off regions , appealed mournfully to the heart ; the doctor , in presence of these touching regrets , felt his eyes fill with tears . at the very same place which franklin and his companions passed full of energy and hope , there only remained a block of marble in remembrance ! and notwithstanding this sombre warning of destiny , the forward was going to follow in the track of the erebus and the terror . hatteras was the first to rouse himself from the perilous contemplation , and quickly climbed a rather steep hill , almost entirely bare of snow .
shandon had not spoken a word . after walking for a few minutes , johnson stopped .

chapter xxiii
" it ' s the only thing we can do . they wouldn ' t believe me . "
" it ' s a good thing that cold makes ice and snow , and so gives us the means of protecting ourselves against it . i don ' t know what we should do if it did not . "
" why , it deceived us about the size as it did about the distance . it made us see a bear in a fox ' s skin . "
" well , " answered johnson , " now we ' ve got him , we ' ll eat him . "
johnson had the job of clearing the water-hole the next day , and remarked that the ice was more than ten feet thick . the doctor could observe magnificent aurora borealis almost every night ; from four till eight p . m . the sky became slightly coloured in the north ; then this colouring took the regular form of a pale yellow border , whose extremities seemed to buttress on to the ice-field . little by little the brilliant zone rose in the sky , following the magnetic meridian , and appeared <unk> with blackish bands ; jets of some luminous matter , <unk> and diminishing , shot out lengthways ; the meteor , arrived at its zenith , was often composed of several bows , bathed in floods of red , yellow , or green light . it was a dazzling spectacle . soon the different curves all joined in one point , and formed boreal crowns of a heavenly richness . at last the bows joined , the splendid aurora faded , the intense rays melted into pale , vague , <unk> shades , and the marvellous phenomenon , feeble , and almost extinguished , fainted insensibly into the dark southern clouds . nothing can equal the wonders of such a spectacle under the high latitudes less than eight degrees from the pole ; the aurora borealis perceived in temperate regions gives no idea of them - not even a feeble one ; it seems as if providence wished to reserve its most astonishing marvels for these climates .
" what is it ? " asked the latter .
" yes , sir , " answered the old sailor , " i ' ll stop if you wish . "

and the room shouted with laughter , but not a <unk> was bid .
" no , " answered the auctioneer , " but it is not impossible that there are , and the state <unk> all its rights over the gold lands . "
repeated cries of " hush ! " told the two worthy tradesmen to be quiet . all wished to hear . all hearts <unk> . dare any one raise his voice in answer to the voice of william w . kolderup ? he , magnificent to look upon , never moved . there he remained as calm as if the matter had no interest for him . but - and this those near to him noticed - his eyes were like revolvers loaded with dollars , ready to fire .
i am not quite sure which mathematician it was who had demonstrated by <unk> calculations , that so great was his mass that it actually influenced that of our satellite and in an appreciable manner disturbed the elements of the lunar orbit .
godfrey was in his <unk> year . his education now finished , had left him with absolutely nothing to do . he had <unk> at the university , but had found it of little use . for him life opened out but paths of ease ; go where he would , to the right or the left , whichever way he went , fortune would not fail him .
an error , because at the outset godfrey felt that he was not yet old enough for the serious undertaking of marriage ; an omission , because he had not been consulted on the subject .
a nod from the merchant gave him to understand that the audience had terminated . he retired , considerably agitated , and the performance of the special graces which he usually displayed in this difficult act left a good deal to be desired . in fact , for the first time in his life , professor tartlet , forgetting in his preoccupation the most elementary principles of his art , went out with his toes turned in !
in short , seng vou was a <unk> . the season had ended , crowned with success - perhaps out of proportion to the gold pieces he had amassed - he wished to return to his country otherwise than as a corpse , for chinamen always like to get buried at home and there are special steamers who carry dead celestials and nothing else . at all risks , therefore , he had secretly slipped on board the dream .
and so he never left the deck . a roll sent him rolling from one side to the other , a pitch sent him pitching from one end to the other . he clung to the rails , he clutched the ropes , he assumed every attitude that is absolutely condemned by the principles of the modern <unk> art . ah ! why could he not raise himself into the air by some <unk> movement , and escape the eccentricities of that moving plane ? a dancer of his ancestors had said that he only consented to set foot to the ground so as not to <unk> his companions , but tartlet would willingly never have come down at all on the deck , whose perpetual agitation threatened to hurl him into the abyss .
we must make some <unk> for the terrors of tartlet . to those unaccustomed to the sea , its rolling is of a nature to cause some alarm , and we know that this <unk> had not even till then risked his safety on the peaceable waters of the bay of san francisco ; so that we can forgive his being ill on board a ship in a <unk> breeze , and his feeling terrified at the <unk> of the waves .
" alone ! alone ! " he murmured .
" take off your life-belt , " he said . " it <unk> you and <unk> your movements . "
and farther off , what were those quadrupeds which were gliding in and out of the rocks , and making their way towards the first slopes of the hills , or <unk> beneath some of the green shrubs ? godfrey could not be mistaken . there were a dozen agouties , five or six sheep , and as many goats , who were quietly browsing on the first vegetation on the very edge of the prairie .
" including ourselves ! " answered tartlet <unk> .
it was unheard of . we must <unk> , however , that on this occasion the tradition was broken . in vain did they search along the rocky shore on the southern part of the bay . not a cavern , not a grotto , not a hole was there that would serve as a shelter . they had to give up the idea . godfrey resolved to reconnoitre up to the first trees in the background beyond the sandy coast .
when godfrey had found his fairly acceptable shelter , his sleep in it was by no means undisturbed . his brain travelled as it had never done before . ideas of all kinds were associated together : those of the past which he bitterly regretted , those of the present of which he sought the realization , those of the future which disquieted him more than all !
there was also the washing of the linen in the clear water of the stream , which occupied the leisure of tartlet . it was to him that this task fell ; but he only had to see to the two shirts , two handkerchiefs , and two pairs of socks , which composed the entire wardrobe of both .
suddenly , in the midst of the general uproar , a vivid flash illuminated the atmosphere . the thunder-clap followed immediately , and will tree was <unk> from top to bottom with the electric force .
and to get an answer to this question , the idea occurred to him to examine the trunk of the sequoia from the out side .
here he devised his <unk> , and in it the fowls took up their abode . the hens soon became accustomed to their home , and settled themselves to set on eggs placed in the dried grass , and chickens began to multiply . every evening the <unk> were driven in and shut up , so as to keep them from birds of prey , who , aloft in the branches , watched their easy victims , and would , if they could , have ended by destroying them .
godfrey did not dream of taking all the things to will tree at once . their transport would necessitate several journeys but he would have to make haste for fear of bad weather .
" no - alone ! "
this he immediately attempted .
however , in spite of the recommendations which were addressed to him , tartlet , <unk> against an occasional stump , had two or three falls which might have complicated matters . godfrey was beginning to regret having brought such a clumsy assistant . indeed , the poor man could not be much help to him . doubtless he would have been worth more left behind at will tree ; or , if he would not consent to that , hidden away in some nook in the forest . but it was too late . an hour after he had left the sequoia group , godfrey and his companion had come a mile - only a mile - for the path was not easy beneath the high vegetation and between the luxuriant shrubs . neither one nor the other of our friends had seen anything suspicious .
twenty minutes had barely elapsed , when the chief approached the fire . then by a gesture he pointed out the prisoner to the savages who were expecting his orders .
with the first days of november it could be said that the wet season had commenced in this unknown latitude . cold rains fell for many hours . later on probably they would experience those interminable showers which do not cease for weeks at a time , and are characteristic of the rainy period of winter in these latitudes .
at noon , after having had some food , without , however , stopping for an instant , they reached the first line of rocks which bordered the beach . the smoke , still visible , was rising about a quarter of a mile ahead . they had only to keep straight on to reach their goal .
under their influence , fearing some approaching misfortune , he had hastened his return to will tree .
it was six months since the survivors of the dream had remained without communication with the rest of the world .
" yes ! things were going too smoothly in your island , and we had to get up a little excitement ! "
" well , " answered the uncle , " we will take away some of the seed , and plant it in my garden at ' <unk> ! "
seng vou advanced towards william w . kolderup .
a few days afterwards there was celebrated with great pomp the wedding of the nephew and pupil of william w . kolderup . that the young couple were made much of by all the friends of the wealthy merchant can easily be imagined .
he left <unk> in 400 , being then twenty years of age , and probably directed his steps first to egypt , visiting <unk> , <unk> , and thebes . he seems to have specially turned his attention to the overflow of the banks of the nile , and he gives an account of the different opinions held as to the source of this river , which the egyptians worshipped as one of their deities . " when the nile <unk> its banks , " he says , " you can see nothing but the towns rising out of the water , and they appear like the islands in the <unk> sea . " he tells of the religious ceremonies among the egyptians , their sacrifices , their ardour in celebrating the <unk> in honour of their goddess isis , which took place principally at <unk> ( whose ruins may still be seen near <unk> ) , and of the veneration paid to both wild and tame animals , which were looked upon almost as sacred , and to whom they even rendered funeral honours at their death . he <unk> in the most faithful colours , the nile crocodile , its form , habits , and the way in which it is caught , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the phoenix , the <unk> , and the serpents that were consecrated to the god jupiter . nothing can be more <unk> than his accounts of egyptian customs , and the notices of their habits , their games , and their way of <unk> the dead , in which the chemists of that period seem to have excelled . then we have the history of the country from <unk> , its first king , downwards to herodotus ' time , and he describes the building of the pyramids under <unk> , the labyrinth that was built a little above the lake <unk> ( of which the remains were discovered in a . d . 1700 ) , lake <unk> itself , whose origin he <unk> to the hand of man , and the two pyramids which are situated a little above the lake . he seems to have admired many of the egyptian temples , and especially that of <unk> at <unk> , and of <unk> and isis at <unk> , and the colossal <unk> that was three years in course of transportation from <unk> to <unk> , though 2000 men were employed on the gigantic work .
we next find that he went southward to arabia , and he calls it the ethiopia of asia , for he thought the southern parts of arabia were the limits of human habitation . he tells us of the remarkable way in which the arabs kept any vow that they might have made ; that their two deities were <unk> and <unk> , and of the abundant growth of <unk> , cinnamon and other spices , and he gives a very interesting account of their culture and preparation .
he spent five months in java , and then set sail for canton ; but the winds were again unfavourable , and after undergoing great hardships he landed at the town of <unk> of the present day ; then having spent some time at <unk> he returned to <unk> , his native town , after an absence of eighteen months . such is the account of fa-hian ' s travels , which have been well translated by m . abel de <unk> , and which give very interesting details of indian and tartar customs , especially those relating to their religious ceremonies .
mohammed fitted out another expedition , and again appointed the arabian traveller as his ambassador . this time they passed through the enemy ' s country without <unk> , and by way of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , they reached malabar . some time after , they arrived at the great port of calicut , an important place which became afterwards the chief town of malabar ; here they were detained by contrary winds for three months , and made use of this time to study the chinese mercantile marine which frequented this port . ibn speaks with great admiration of these junks which are like floating gardens , where ginger and herbs are grown on deck ; they are each like a separate village , and some merchants were the possessors of a great number of these junks .
béthencourt after leaving rome went to <unk> and to paris , and then to his own <unk> , where a great number of people came to pay their respects to the king of the canary islands , and if on his return the first time he was much thought of , his reception this second time far exceeded it . béthencourt established himself at <unk> ; although he was an old man , his wife was still young . he had frequent accounts from maciot of his beloved islands , and he hoped one day to return to his kingdom , but god <unk> otherwise . one day in the year 1400 he was seized with what proved to be fatal illness ; he was aware that the end was near ; and after making his will and receiving the last <unk> of the church he passed away . " may god keep him and pardon his sins , " says the narrative of his life ; " he is buried in the church of <unk> la <unk> , in front of the high altar . "
however it may have been , in 1400 we find him again in spain . this great man was poor , without resources . he travelled on foot , carrying diego his little son of ten years old , in his arms . from this period of his life , history follows him step by step ; she no more loses sight of him , and she has preserved to posterity the smallest incidents of this grand existence . we find columbus arrived in andalusia , only half a league from the port of palos . destitute , and dying of hunger , he knocked at the door of a franciscan convent , dedicated to santa maria de <unk> , and asked for a little bread and water for his poor child and for himself . the superior of the convent , juan <unk> de <unk> , gave hospitality to the unfortunate traveller . he questioned him , and was surprised by the <unk> of his language , but still more astonished was he , by the boldness of the ideas of columbus , who made the good father the confidant of his aspirations . for several months the wandering sailor remained in this hospitable convent ; some of the monks were learned men , and interested themselves about him and his projects ; they studied his plans ; they mentioned him to some of the well-known navigators of the time ; and we must give them the credit of having been the first to believe in the genius of christopher columbus . juan <unk> showed still greater kindness ; he offered to take upon himself the charge of the education of diego , and he gave to columbus a letter of recommendation addressed to the <unk> of the queen of castille .
during the following days a large number of birds , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , flew around the caravels . columbus turned their presence to account as a means of reassuring his companions , who were beginning to be terribly frightened at not meeting with land after six weeks of sailing . his own confidence never abated , but putting firm trust in god , he often addressed energetic words of comfort to those around him , and made them each evening chant the salve <unk> , or some other hymn to the virgin . at the words of this heroic man , so noble , so sure of himself , so superior to all human <unk> , the courage of the sailors revived , and they again went onwards .
at this moment , some naked savages appeared upon the newly discovered coast . columbus had his long boat lowered , and got into it with alonzo and <unk> pinzon , the <unk> rodrigo , the secretary <unk> , and some others . he landed upon the shore , carrying in his hand the royal banner , whilst the two captains bore between them the green banner of the cross , upon which were interlaced , the initials of ferdinand and isabella . then the admiral solemnly took possession of the island in the name of the king and queen of spain , and caused a record of the act to be drawn up . during this ceremony the natives came round columbus and his companions . m . charton gives the account of the scene in the very words of columbus : " desiring to inspire them ( the natives ) with friendship for us , and being persuaded , on seeing them , that they would confide the more readily in us , and be the better disposed towards embracing our holy faith , if we used mildness in persuading them , rather than if we had recourse to force , i caused to be given to several amongst them , coloured caps , and also glass beads , which they put around their necks . i added various other articles of small value ; they testified great joy , and showed so much gratitude that we <unk> greatly at it . when we were <unk> , they swam towards us , to offer us parroquets , balls of cotton thread , <unk> ( or long darts ) , and many other things ; in exchange we gave them some small glass beads , little bells , and other objects . they gave us all they had , but they appeared to me to be very poor . the men and women both were as naked as when they were born . amongst those whom we saw , one woman was rather young , and none of the men appeared to be more than thirty years of age . they were well made , their figures handsome , and their faces agreeable . their hair , coarse as that of a horse ' s tail , hung down in front as low as their eyebrows , behind it formed a long mass , which they never cut . there are some who paint themselves with a blackish <unk> ; their natural colour being neither black nor white , but similar to that of the inhabitants of the canary islands ; some paint themselves with white , some with red , or any other colour , either covering the whole body with it , or the whole face , or perhaps only the eyes , or the nose . they do not carry arms like our people , and do not even know what they are . when i showed them some swords , they laid hold of them by the blades , and cut their fingers . they have no iron ; their <unk> are sticks , the tip is not of iron , but sometimes made of a fish tooth , or of some other hard substance . they have much grace in their movements . i remarked that several had <unk> upon their bodies , and i asked them by means of signs , how they had been wounded . they answered in the same manner , that the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands had come to attack them , and make them prisoners , and that they had defended themselves . i thought then and i still think that they must have come from the mainland to make them prisoners for slaves ; they would be faithful and gentle servants . they seem to have the power of repeating quickly what they hear . i am persuaded that they might be converted to christianity without difficulty , for i believe that they belong to no sect . "
columbus left cadiz on the 9 th of may , 1500 , with crews numbering in all 100 men . he took with him his brother bartolomeo , and his son fernando , the child of his second marriage , and at this time scarcely thirteen years old . on the 0 th of may , the vessels stopped at gran canaria , and on the 5 th of june arrived at martinique , one of the windward islands ; afterwards they touched at dominica , <unk> , and <unk> , and at length , after a prosperous voyage , reached hispaniola , on the 9 th of june . the intention of columbus , acting on the queen ' s advice , was not to land upon the island whence he had been so <unk> expelled ; but his <unk> ship was scarcely <unk> , and repairs to the keel were greatly needed . therefore the admiral demanded permission of the governor to enter the harbour .
the caravels let in water in every direction , and the admiral was obliged to run them aground ; he then tried to organize a life in common upon shore . the indians at first gave him assistance , and furnished the crews with the provisions of which they were in need , but the miserable and much tried sailors showed resentment against the admiral ; they were ready for revolt , while the unfortunate columbus , exhausted by illness , was confined to a bed of pain . it was in these trying circumstances that two brave officers , mendez and fieschi , proposed to the admiral to attempt to cross from jamaica to hispaniola in indian canoes . this was in reality a voyage of six hundred miles , for it was necessary to row along the coast as far as the port where the colony was established . but these courageous officers were ready to face every peril , when it was a question of saving their companions . columbus , appreciating the boldness of a proposal , which under other circumstances he would himself have been the first to make , gave the required permission to mendez and fieschi , who set out , while he , without ships , almost without provisions , remained with his crew upon this uncultivated island .
vincent sodrez had arrived at the straits of bab-el-mandeb , when a fearful tempest occurred , in which his ship split upon the rocks , and he and his brother perished . the survivors regarded this event as a judgment of providence for their bad conduct , and they made haste , with all sails set to return to cochin . they were detained by contrary winds at the <unk> islands , and were there joined by another portuguese squadron under the command of francisco d ' albuquerque , who had sailed from lisbon almost at the same time as his cousin alfonzo d ' albuquerque the most distinguished captain of the period , who with the title of capitam mõr had started from belem at the beginning of april , 1500 .
" if it were true , " says <unk> , " that vespucius had discovered the american continent , yet the glory would not be his ; it belongs undoubtedly to the man who had the genius and courage to undertake the first voyage , to columbus . " as newton says in his argument with leibnitz , " the glory is due only to the inventor . " but we agree with m . <unk> when he says , " how can we allow that there was an expedition in 1400 which resulted in the discovery of above 2500 miles of the coast-line of the mainland , when there is no trace of it left either among the great historians of that time , or in the legal <unk> in connexion with the claims made by the heir of columbus against the spanish government , in which the priority of the discoveries of each leader of an expedition is carefully mentioned , with the part of the coast explored by each ? " finally , the authentic documents extracted from the archives of the <unk> de <unk> make it evident that vespucius was entrusted with the preparation of the vessels destined for the third voyage of columbus at seville and at san lucar from the middle of august , 1400 , till the departure of columbus on the 0 th of may , 1400 . the narratives of the voyages of vespucius are very diffuse and wanting in precision and order ; the information they give upon the places he visited is so vague , that it might apply to one part of the coast as well as to another ; as to the localities treated of , as well as of the companions of vespucius , there are no indications given of a nature to aid the historian . not a single name is given of any well-known person , and the dates are contradictory in those famous letters which have given endless work to <unk> . humboldt says of them " there is an element of discord in the most authentic documents relating to the <unk> navigator . " we have given an account of hojeda ' s first voyage , which <unk> with that of vespucius according to humboldt , who has compared the principal incidents of the two narratives . <unk> asserts that vespucius , having started on the 0 th of may , 1400 , entered the gulf of honduras on the 0 th of june , coasted by yucatan and mexico , sailed up the mississippi , and at the end of february , 1400 , doubled the cape of florida . after anchoring for thirty-seven days at the mouth of the st . lawrence , he returned to cadiz in october , 1400 .
some years later , when <unk> was better informed as to the real discoverer of america and of the value to be placed upon the voyages of vespucius , he <unk> from his book all that related to the latter , and substituted everywhere the name of columbus for that of vespucius , but it was too late , the same error has prevailed ever since .
with the same object diego de <unk> , a rich colonist of hispaniola , organized an expedition in 1500 .
after thirteen days ' sailing , grijalva reached the island of <unk> on the coast of yucatan , doubled the cape of <unk> , and entered the bay of <unk> . he disembarked on the 0 th of may at <unk> , of which the inhabitants defended the town and citadel vigorously , in spite of their astonishment at the vessels , which they took for some kind of marine monsters , and their fear of the <unk> men who hurled <unk> . fifty-seven spaniards were killed in the engagement , and many were wounded . this warm reception did not encourage grijalva to make any long stay amongst this warlike people . he set sail again after anchoring for four days , took a westerly course along the coast of mexico , and on the 9 th of may entered a river named by the natives the <unk> , where he soon found himself surrounded by a fleet of fifty native boats filled with warriors ready for the conflict , but thanks to grijalva ' s prudence and the amicable demonstrations which he made , peace was not disturbed .
after suppressing some attempts at mutiny amongst the soldiers , in which those who had come with narvaez were the most to blame , cortès again marched forwards , and , with the help of the tlascalans , first attacked the people of <unk> and of other neighbouring provinces , a measure which had the advantage of exercising anew his own troops in war , and of training his allies . while this was going on , two brigantines bringing ammunition and reinforcements fell into the hands of cortès ; these ships had been sent to narvaez by velasquez , in ignorance of his <unk> ; at this time also some spaniards sent by francis de <unk> , governor of jamaica , joined the army . in consequence of these reinforcements the troops with cortès , after he had rid himself of several partisans of narvaez with whom he was dissatisfied , amounted to five hundred infantry , of whom eighty carried muskets , and forty horse-soldiers . with this small army , and with one thousand tlascalans , cortès set out once more for mexico on the 8 th of december , 1500 , six months after he had been forced to abandon the city . this campaign had for its theatre countries already described , and must therefore be passed over somewhat rapidly here , notwithstanding the interest attaching to it ; to enter fully into the history of the conquest of mexico would not be in accordance with the primary object of this work .
while pizarro was an <unk> child , diego de almagro was a <unk> , picked up according to some in 1400 at <unk> del rey , but according to others at almagro , from which circumstance , as they maintain , he derived his name . he was educated in the midst of soldiers , and while still young went to america , where he had succeeded in <unk> a small fortune .
upon his return to san lucar on the 6 th of september , 1500 , after having fulfilled the vow which he had made to go <unk> to return thanks to <unk> señora de la victoria , the <unk> ( as they called him on board the victoria , ) presented to charles v . , then at valladolid , a complete journal of the voyage . when he returned to italy , by means of the original as well as of some supplementary notes , he wrote a longer narrative of the expedition , at the request of pope clement vii . and of <unk> de l ' isle adam , <unk> of the knights of malta . he sent copies of this work to several distinguished personages , and notably to <unk> of savoy , mother of francis i . but she not understanding , so thinks <unk> , the very learned author of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the kind of <unk> used by pigafetta , and which resembles a mixture of italian , venetian , and spanish , employed a certain jacques antoine <unk> to translate it into french . instead of giving a faithful translation , <unk> made a kind of <unk> of it . some critics , however , suppose that this narrative must have been written originally in french ; they found their opinion upon the existence of three french manuscripts of the sixteenth century , which give very different readings , and of which two are deposited in the <unk> <unk> at paris .
from the collection of facts which have been here briefly given , it follows that america was known to europeans and had been colonized before the time of columbus . but in consequence of various circumstances , and foremost among these must be placed the rarity of communication between the people in the north of europe and those in the south , the discoveries made by the northmen were only vaguely known in spain and portugal . judging by appearances , we of the present day know much more on this subject than did the fellow-countrymen and contemporaries of columbus . if the genoese mariner had been informed of the existence of some rumours , he classed them with the information he had collected in the cape de verd islands and with his <unk> recollections of the famous island of <unk> and the <unk> of plato . from this information , which came from so many different sides , the certainty awoke within him that the east could be reached by the western route . however it may be , his glory remains whole and entire ; he is really the discoverer of america , and not those who were carried thither in spite of themselves by chances of wind and storm , without their having any intention of reaching the shores of asia , which christopher columbus would have done , had not the way been barred by america .
such was the <unk> that was granted to john cabot and his sons upon their return from the american continent , and not as certain authors have pretended , anterior to this voyage . from the time that the news of the discovery made by columbus had reached england , that is to say , probably in 1400 , john and sebastian cabot prepared the expedition at their own expense , and set out at the beginning of the year 1400 , with the idea of reaching cathay , and finally the indies . there can be no doubt upon this point , for in the <unk> <unk> in paris is preserved an unique copy of the map engraved in 1500 , that is to say , in the lifetime of sebastian cabot , which mentions this voyage , and the precise and exact date of the discovery of cape breton .
" the next day the lord of canada , called <unk> , with twelve boats and accompanied by sixteen men , approached the ships . when abreast of the smallest of our vessels he began to make a palaver or <unk> in their fashion , while moving his body and limbs in a marvellous manner , which is a sign of joy and confidence , and when he arrived at the flag-ship where were the two indians who had been brought back from france , the said chief spoke to them and they to him . and they began to relate to him what they had seen in france and the good treatment which they had received , at which the said chief was very joyful , and begged the captain to give him his arms that he might kiss and embrace them , which is their mode of welcome in this country . the country of <unk> , or st . charles , is fertile and full of very fine trees of the same nature and kind as in france , such as oaks , elms , <unk> , <unk> , cedars , vines , <unk> - which bear fruit as large as <unk> - and other trees ; beneath them grows hemp as good as that of france . " cartier succeeded afterwards in reaching with his boats and his galleon a place which is the <unk> of the present day , next , a great lake formed by the river - st . peter ' s lake - and at last he arrived at hochelaga or montreal , which is 600 miles from the mouth of the st . lawrence . in this place are " ploughed lands and large and beautiful plains full of the corn of the country , which is like the millet of brazil , as large or larger than peas , on which they live as we do on wheat . and among these plains is placed and seated the said town of hochelaga near to and joining on to some high ground which is around the town ; and which is well cultivated and quite small ; from the top of it one can see very far . we named this mountain the mount royal . "
on the 7 th january , 1500 , cavendish entered the strait of magellan , and in the narrowest part of it received on board his ships <unk> spaniards and two women , the sole survivors of the colony founded three years previously , under the name of <unk> , by captain sarmiento . this town , which had been built to bar the passage through the strait , had possessed no fewer than four forts as well as several churches . cavendish could discern the fortress , then deserted and already falling into ruins . its inhabitants , who had been completely prevented by the continual attacks of the savages from gathering in their harvests , had died of hunger , or had perished in endeavouring to reach the spanish settlements in chili . the admiral , upon hearing this lamentable tale , changed the name of <unk> into that of port famine , under which appellation the place is known at the present day . on the 20st the ships entered a beautiful bay , which received the name of elizabeth , and in which was buried the carpenter of the hugh gallant . not far from thence a fine river fell into the sea , on the banks of which dwelt the anthropophagi who had fought so fiercely with the spaniards , and who endeavoured , but in vain , to entice the englishmen into the interior of the country .

although galileo had observed the eclipses of jupiter ' s satellites as early as 1600 , his important discovery had been rendered useless by the indifference of governments , the <unk> of instruments , and the mistakes committed by his followers .
<unk> <unk> est <unk> <unk> et c ' est la <unk> <unk> l ' on fit en <unk> au <unk> <unk> .
after numerous obstacles , which it is impossible to give in detail , after curious discoveries , as for example the attraction exercised on the pendulum by mountains , the french <unk> arrived at conclusions which fully confirmed the result of the expedition to lapland . they did not all return to france at the same time .
up to this date the position of the island of juan fernandez , was differently given on nearly all maps , and wood rogers , who intended to harbour there , take in water , and get a little fresh meat , came upon it almost unawares .
commodore john byron , born on the 8 th of november , 1700 , was the man selected . from his earliest years , he had shown an enthusiastic love of seafaring life , and at the age of seventeen had offered his services upon one of the vessels that formed admiral anson ' s squadron , when it was sent out for the destruction of spanish settlements upon the pacific coast .
the next morning a terrible gale of wind arose , <unk> by the piercing cries of many hundred birds flying before it . it lasted only twenty minutes - sufficiently long , however , to throw the vessel on its beam end before it was possible to let go the <unk> . at the same moment a blow from the sheet of the mainsail overthrew the first lieutenant , and sent him rolling to a distance , while the mizen-mast , which was not entirely lowered , was torn to pieces .
the women rode on horseback like the men without stirrups , and all galloped on the shore , although it was covered with immense stones and very slippery .
byron was anxious to <unk> the <unk> misery of his unfortunate crew , and giving the name of disappointment islands to the group , he set sail once more on the 8 th of june .
the ships ' boats , well armed and equipped , reached the shore under command of lieutenant furneaux . a quantity of cocoa-nuts and anti-scorbutic plants were obtained , but although the english found huts and sheds , they did not meet with a single inhabitant . this island was discovered on the eve of whitsunday and hence received the name whitsunday .
nevertheless , carteret allowed none of his apprehensions to come to the knowledge of the crew . at first the detestable weather experienced by the swallow upon the pacific ocean ( most <unk> name ) , allowed no time for reflection . the dangers of the passing moment , in which there was every prospect of their being engulfed , hid from them the perils of the future .
" their arrows are tipped with stone , and we saw no metal of any kind in their possession . the country in general is covered with woods and mountains and interspersed with a great number of valleys . "
at the south-western extremity of new ireland carteret found another land , to which he gave the name of new <unk> , and shortly afterwards the group of the duke of portland .
all carteret ' s representations , his remarks upon the <unk> of the refusal , even his hostile demonstrations , had no other result than the sale of a few provisions , and permission to proceed to a small neighbouring bay .
of the three <unk> he thus entered upon , he entirely abandoned the two first , slightly neglected the third , for the sake of a fourth - diplomacy , and finally left it entirely for a fifth - the naval service . he was destined to die a member of the senate after a sixth <unk> .
" four streams flowed into the harbour in a space measuring four hundred paces . we selected three , according to custom ; one to supply water for la boudeuse , one for the etoile , and one for washing purposes . wood was plentiful on the shore , and there were various kinds of it , all good for burning , and several first-rate for <unk> , <unk> , and even <unk> .
the <unk> islands , the largest of which is only four miles in length , were next seen , but the bad weather and the currents forced the two vessels to remain in the open sea and relinquish all exploration . it was necessary , however , to maintain a close watch in order to avoid missing the outlet into the indian ocean . <unk> and waigiou , the last at the extreme north of new guinea , were passed in succession .
he took part in the american war , and in 1700 participated in an honourable combat before port royal off martinique . made chief of the fleet in 1700 , he , ten years later , received a commission to re-establish order in the mutinous fleet of m . d ' albert de <unk> . created vice-admiral in 1700 , he did not think it right to accept a high rank , which was , to use his own words , " a title without duties . "

charles green , assistant to dr . <unk> , of greenwich observatory , embarked with him . to green was entrusted the astronomical department , doctor solander , a swedish doctor of medicine , a <unk> of <unk> , and professor at the british museum , undertook the botanical part . finally , sir joseph banks joined the expedition , out of simple interest , anxious to employ his energy and fortune . after leaving <unk> , sir joseph banks had visited the newfoundland coast and labrador , and had there acquired a taste for botany . two <unk> accompanied the expedition , one a landscape and portrait painter , the other a scientific draughtsman . in addition to these persons , the company comprised a secretary and four servants , two of whom were negroes .
smoke was perceived at different points , and the details of the shore were soon mastered . the hills were covered with verdure , and large trees were distinguishable in the valleys . then houses were perceived , then pirogues , then the natives assembled on the strand . and lastly , a <unk> , high and regularly built , surrounded the summit of the hill . opinions varied as to the nature of this object ; some declaring it to be a deer park , others a cattle enclosure , not to speak of many equally ingenious <unk> , which were all proved false , when later it turned out to be a " pah . "
returning on board , the <unk> were stopped by an old man , who insisted upon their taking part in the military exercises of the country with the lance and the <unk> .
although quarrels with the natives were frequent , the latter were not invariably in the wrong .
almost at the southern extremity of this coast , a bay was discovered , which received the name of dusky . this region was sterile , steep , covered with snow . dusky bay was three or four miles in width at its entrance , and appeared as deep as it was wide . several islands were contained in it , behind which a vessel would have excellent shelter ; but cook thought it prudent not to remain there , as he knew that the wind , which would enable him to leave the bay , blew only once a month in these latitudes . he differed upon this point with several of his officers , who thinking only of the present advantage , did not reflect upon the inconveniences of a stay in port , the duration of which would be uncertain .
on the 9 th , cook landed with banks and solander in a large bay , in search of a spot where he could have the keel and bottom of his vessel repaired , but they were scarcely on terra firma , when they found their progress impeded by a thick shrub , <unk> and studded with sharp seeds , no doubt a species of " <unk> , " which clung to the clothes , pierced them , and penetrated the flesh . at the same time , myriads of <unk> and mosquitoes attacked them , and covered them with painful <unk> .
shortly after nine in the evening the soundings taken every quarter of an hour showed constantly decreasing depth . all crowded to the deck . the water became deeper . it was concluded that the vessel had passed over the extremity of the sand-banks seen at sunset , and all rejoiced at escape from danger . when the depth increased , cook and all but the officers of the watch retired to their berths , but at eleven o ' clock the sounding-line , after indicating twenty fathoms , suddenly recorded seventeen , and before it was possible to cast anchor , the endeavour had touched , and beaten by the waves , struck upon a rock .
william <unk> , a landscape painter , two naturalists , john <unk> forster and his son george ; two astronomers , w . wales and w . <unk> , accompanied the expedition , provided with the best instruments for observation .
after leaving these islands , on the 2 th of april , and sailing for tahiti , cook fell in , five days later , with the pomotou archipelago . he landed on the <unk> island of byron . the inhabitants , who had cause to complain of earlier navigators , received the advances of the english coldly . the latter could only obtain about two dozen cocoa-nuts and five pigs , which appeared plentiful in this island . in another settlement a more friendly reception was met with . the natives embraced the new-comers , and rubbed their noses in the same fashion as the new zealanders . oedidi bought several dogs , the long and white hair of whose skins serves as an ornament for <unk> in his native land .
no sooner was anchor cast than fifteen or more pirogues surrounded the vessel . the natives had sufficient confidence to approach and begin traffic . some of them even entered the ship , and inspected all the various parts of it with extreme curiosity . they refused to touch the dishes offered them , stewed peas , beef , and salt pork , but they voluntarily tasted the yams . they were most surprised at the goats , pigs , dogs , and cats , which were so strange to them that they had no words to designate them . nails , all iron implements , and red stuffs , appeared precious to them . tall , strong , and <unk> , with curly hair and beard , and of dark chocolate colour , they spoke a language which bore no resemblance to any which the english had hitherto heard .
cook also observed the presence of minerals on the hills , and his discovery has been verified in late years by the proved existence of gold , iron , copper , coal , and <unk> .
after steering southwards for twelve days , two islands were discovered in 40 degrees 50 minutes south latitude , and 30 degrees 40 minutes east longitude . the strait which separates them was crossed , and it was found that their steep sterile coasts were uninhabited . they had been discovered with four others , from nine to twelve degrees further east , by the french captains <unk> and crozet , in 1700 .
not wishing to be <unk> in the attempt at display , the natives gave a concert , and then a dance , executed by twenty women crowned with china roses . this magnificent ballet was followed by another performance by fifteen men . but we shall never end , if we attempt to give an account of the wonders of this enthusiastic reception . it justly gained for the tonga archipelago the name of friendly islands .
leaving tonga tabou on the 0 th of july , cook repaired to the small of eoa , where his old friend <unk> received him cordially . the captain learned from him that the property of the various islands in the archipelago belonged to the chiefs of tonga tabou , which was known as the land of the chiefs . thus poulaho had a hundred and fifty islands under his rule . the most important are <unk> and <unk> . as for the <unk> islands , which are comprised in this number , they were inhabited by a warlike race , very superior in intelligence to those of the friendly islands .
the expression " tabu , " he says , " which plays so great a part in the language of this people , has a very wide significance . when they are not allowed to touch anything they say it is tabu . they also told us that if the king enters a house belonging to one of his subjects , the house becomes ' tabu , ' and the owner of it may not live in it any longer . "
cook , who had silently assisted at the ceremony , could not conceal the horror with which it inspired him . mai interpreted for him , <unk> and forcibly . <unk> could scarcely contain his anger .
the english were not a little surprised at hearing these natives speak in the tahitan language . on this account the intercourse between them was soon friendly , and next day numbers of the islanders agreed to go on board . they showed their astonishment and admiration , at the sight of so many unknown objects , by their looks , gestures , and continual exclamations . iron they were acquainted with , and called " <unk> . "
the expedition , coasting at a distance , surveyed cape blanc , already seen by martin d ' <unk> on the 9 th of january , 1600 , and near which the geographers placed a large opening , to the strait , the discovery of which they attributed to him . shortly afterwards the latitude of juan de fuca was reached , but nothing resembling it was discovered , although this strait really exists , and divides the continent from vancouver ' s island .
the captain says : -
" this land was supposed , " says m . <unk> , judging from <unk> ' charts , which were used by bouvet , " to be situated in 50 degrees s . lat . and 20 degrees and 20 degrees east of the meridian of teneriffe , or between 5 degrees 30 minutes and 6 degrees 3 minutes east of that of paris . "
on the next and ensuing days , lofty and mountainous land was constantly in sight . upon the 2nd of november surville descried an island , which received the name of <unk> , from the contrary winds which for three days checked the progress of the ship .
marion continued to steer between 40 degrees to 40 degrees lat . in the midst of a fog so dense that it was impossible to see from one end of the deck to the other , and without constant firing the ships must have parted company . upon the 2nd of february the two ships were in 40 degrees 20 minutes e . long . , that is to say within 1 degree 10 minutes of the lands discovered upon the 3 th of the same month by the king ' s vessels la fortune and le <unk> <unk> , commanded by mm . de kerguelen and saint <unk> . doubtless , but for the accident to the castries , marion would have fallen in with them .
having reached 90 degrees east of the paris meridian , marion changed his route , and directed his course to van diemen ' s land . no incident occurred during the cruise , and the two vessels cast anchor in frederick henry bay .
thirty-four of the crew of the roland had died since leaving the southern regions , and if kerguelen had remained another week in these latitudes , he would have lost a hundred men ! on his return to france , kerguelen met with nothing but ill-will and <unk> , in return for so much fatigue , so bravely born . the feeling against him was so strong that one of his officers was not ashamed to publish a memoir , in which all the facts were dressed up in the most unfavourable shape , and the failure of the enterprise thrown upon kerguelen . we do not assert that he was entirely free from blame , but we consider the verdict of the council of war which deprived him of his rank , and condemned him to detention in the château of <unk> , most unjust . no doubt the judgment was found to be excessive , and the government discerned more malice than justice in it , for a few months later kerguelen was restored to liberty . the gravest charge against him was that of having abandoned his sloop and a portion of his crew , in the southern seas , who , but for the opportune arrival of the fortune , must have perished . probably , however , even this was much exaggerated , for a letter exists from the abandoned officer , m . de <unk> ( afterwards vice-admiral ) , in which he begs to serve again under kerguelen . the account of these expeditions is an extract from the apology published by kerguelen during his imprisonment , a work which was <unk> by government , and on that account is extremely rare .
the two frigates sailed upon the 1st of august , 1700 , and anchored off madeira thirteen days later .
while the astronomers devoted themselves to estimating the regularity of the astronomical watches , the naturalists , with several officers , ascended the peak , and collected some curious plants . <unk> succeeded in measuring this mountain with much greater accuracy than his predecessors , <unk> , <unk> , bouguer , verdun , and <unk> , who calculated its height respectively at 2400 , 2200 , 2100 , and 1900 fathoms . unfortunately his work , which would have settled the discussion , never reached france .
upon the 4 th of december the astrolabe and the boussole sighted the <unk> islands . a landing was effected upon the volcanic island of assumption . here the lava had formed ravines and precipices , bordered by a few stunted cocoa-nut trees , alternately with tropical creepers and a few shrubs . it was almost impossible to advance a couple of hundred yards in an hour . landing and <unk> were difficult , and the few cocoa-nut shells and bananas , of a new variety , which the naturalists obtained , were not worth the risk .
" m . <unk> and m . auribeau , " says the narrative , " were encouraged to land by the sight of fires close to the shore . they had gone but a short distance when they came upon four natives , attending to three small fires , by which they were seated . they took to flight on seeing the strangers , in spite of every friendly demonstration , leaving the <unk> and shell-fish which they had been <unk> . as many huts as there were fires were close by .
" we were also provided with cloves and nutmegs preserved in sugar . the shell of the <unk> is the only edible portion ; unfortunately , ignorant <unk> had chosen <unk> nutmegs . cloves , when once as large as ordinary olives , retain too much flavour to be a pleasant <unk> . one must be endowed with an indian palate to enjoy them . i might say the same of our ginger preserves .
it is true that their information , as far as it related to la perouse , was in direct contradiction to the facts which <unk> collected thirty-six years later , when <unk> was queen .
" one of them , who was enjoying a broiled bone , and busily devouring the meat which still clung to it , offered a share of his meal to a sailor named <unk> . he , thinking it to be the bone of some animal , accepted it , but before eating it showed it to me . i at once recognized that it had belonged to the body of a child , of probably fourteen or fifteen years of age . the natives crowding round us , showed us upon a living child the position of the bone , <unk> without hesitation that the man had been making his meal off it , and giving us to understand that it was a great delicacy .
la billardière ought to have pressed the natives upon this subject . were the vessels seen by them those of la perouse or of d ' entrecasteaux : and was it really " a year previously " ?
this survey accomplished , <unk> , <unk> , and endracht islands were next to be visited , swan river to be followed as far as possible , and a survey taken of <unk> island and the coast near it . from thence the expedition was to proceed to shark bay , to determine various points in de witt land , and , leaving the coast at north west cape , to go to timor , in the moluccas , for a <unk> rest .
after allowing sufficient time for the crews to recover from their fatigue , the coast of new guinea was to be surveyed , with the view to ascertaining whether it was broken up into islands by various straits , the further portion of gulf of carpentaria was to be explored , various districts in <unk> land were to be reconnoitred , and from thence the expedition was to proceed to mauritius , on its way to europe .
" carrying this calculation on at the same rate for a period of thirty years , or even reducing the increase by one half , it is clear that new south wales would be teeming throughout its length and breadth with cattle .
in the preface to the second edition of his " voyage de la corvette <unk> " which was revised and corrected by louis de freycinet , péron has given each his due <unk> of praise ; and to his able work we refer all readers who are interested in the question .

the immense number of <unk> in the neighbourhood of the town , especially on the hill overlooking it , indicate a dense population in ancient times . the traveller endeavoured vainly to obtain a perfect head from one of these <unk> . amongst the skulls he procured , he found no certain proof that they had been filled with resin . he met with many fragments of clothing , but they were all in such a state of decay that it was impossible to decide upon their origin or use .
the facts relating to the coast of senegal needed confirmation , but the french superiority was no longer undisputed . the english , with their earnest and enterprising character , were convinced of its importance in the development of their commerce , and determined upon its exploration . but before proceeding to the narrative of the adventures of major houghton and mungo park , we will devote a small space to the record of the work done by the french naturalist , michel adanson .
during his journey mungo park noticed negroes who fed principally upon a sort of bread made from the berries of the lotus , which tasted not unlike <unk> . this plant , the <unk> lotus , is indigenous in senegambia , <unk> , and tunis .
in his account of their method of cutting the <unk> bruce says , " the skin which had covered the flesh that was cut away was left intact , and was fastened to the corresponding part by little wooden <unk> serving as pins . whether they put anything between the skin and the wounded flesh i do not know , but they soon covered the wound with mud . they then forced the animal to rise , and drove it on before them , to furnish them , no doubt , with another meal when they should join their companions in the evening . "
in the province of <unk> , situated amongst the unhealthy and <unk> <unk> mountains , and where many monks had retired to pray and do <unk> , bruce stayed only long enough to rest his beasts of burden , for the country was not only haunted by lions and <unk> , and infested by large black ants , which destroyed part of his baggage , but also torn with civil war ; so that foreigners were anything but safe . this made him most anxious to reach <unk> , but when he arrived <unk> fever was raging fiercely . his knowledge of medicine was very useful to him , and procured him a situation under the governor , which was most advantageous to him , as it rendered him free to scour the country in all directions , at the head of a body of soldiers . by these means he acquired a mass of valuable information upon the government , manners , and customs of the country , and the chief events of its history , which combined to make his work the most important hitherto published about abyssinia .
" polygamy , which it is well known is <unk> by their religion , is indulged in to excess by the people of darfur . when sultan <unk> went to war with <unk> , he took in his <unk> five hundred women , leaving as many in his palace . this may at first sight seem ridiculous , but it must be remembered that these women had to grind corn , draw water , dress food , and perform all the domestic work for a large number of people , so that there was plenty for them to do . "

throughout the arduous survey , occupying four years , of 900 miles of coast , the discovery and chatham lost but two men . it will be seen from this how apt a pupil of cook the great navigator was ; and we do not know whether most to admire in vancouver his care for his sailors and humanity to the natives , or the wonderful nautical skill he displayed in this dangerous cruise .
in a narrative published in the earlier " annales des voyages , " says the traveller , -
upon the 5 th of january , 1800 , burckhardt left mecca with a caravan of pilgrims on their way to visit the tomb of the prophet . the journey to medina , like that between mecca and jeddah , was accomplished at night , and afforded little opportunity for observation . in the winter <unk> is less comfortable than travelling by day . a valley called <unk> , but generally known as <unk> , was crossed ; it abounded in shrubs and date-trees , and was well cultivated in the eastern portion . a little beyond it lies the valley of <unk> , the market of the neighbouring tribes and celebrated for its plantations of dates .
up to this period the india company had been unable to add to the narrow strip of territory which they possessed at the ports , but it was now to benefit by the conflict between the <unk> and rajahs of hindustan . it was not , however , until after the taking of madras , in 1700 , by la <unk> , and the struggle against <unk> , that the influence and dominion of the english company was materially increased .
webb furnishes some details respecting the women of <unk> . they wore necklaces , earrings , and gold and silver ornaments , which were scarcely in keeping with their coarse attire . some of the children wore necklaces and bracelets of silver to the value of six hundred <unk> .
this time the object was to bring back a flock of cashmere goats , whose long silk hair is used in the manufacture of the <unk> shawls . in addition , it was proposed to <unk> the assertion of the hindus that the source of the ganges is beyond the himalayas , in lake <unk> . a difficult and perilous task ! it was first of all necessary to penetrate into nepaul , whilst the government of that country made such an attempt very difficult , and thence to enter a region from which the natives of nepaul are excluded , and with still greater reason the english .
" twenty men , " says moorcroft , " threw themselves upon me . one seized me by my neck , and , pressing his knees against me , tried to strangle me by <unk> my cravat ; another passed a cord round my legs and pulled me from behind . i was on the point of fainting . my gun , upon which i was leaning , escaped my hold ; i fell ; they dragged me up by my feet until i was nearly <unk> . when at last i rose , nothing could exceed the expression of fierce delight on the faces of my conquerors . fearing that i should attempt to escape , two soldiers held me by a rope and gave me a blow from time to time , no doubt to remind me of my position . mr . hearsay had not supposed that he should be attacked so soon ; he was <unk> out his mouth when the hubbub began , and did not hear my cries for help . our men could not find the few arms we possessed ; some escaped , i know not how ; the others were seized , amongst them mr . hearsay . he was not bound as i was ; they contented themselves with holding his arms . "
speaking of the lesghians , who occupy the eastern caucasus , known as <unk> , or <unk> , klaproth says their name is a <unk> , just as <unk> or tartar was used to indicate the natives of northern asia ; adding , that they do not form one nation , as is proved by the number of dialects in use , which , however , would seem to have been derived from a common source , though time has greatly modified them . this is a contradiction in terms , <unk> either that the lesghians , speaking one language , form one nation , or that forming one nation the lesghians speak various dialects derived from the same source .
here and there in the desert are oases containing towns of greater or less importance , at which the caravans halt . <unk> is one of the most frequented of these places , and there the money for the right of crossing the desert is paid . the sultan of <unk> , the ruler of a good many of these petty <unk> , and who takes the title of commander of the faithful , was remarkable for a complete disregard of cleanliness , a peculiarity in which , according to denham , his court fully equalled him .
the explorers had sent a messenger to sheikh el <unk> , to ask permission to enter his capital , and an envoy speedily arrived to invite boo-khaloum and his companions to kouka .
on the 2nd of march , denham returned to kouka , and on the 0 th of may , he was witness to the arrival of lieutenant <unk> , who had come to take up his residence as consul at the court of bornou , bearing costly presents for the sultan .
clapperton tells us that he had hardly entered the gates before his expectations were disappointed ; after the brilliant description of the arabs , he had expected to see a town of vast extent . the houses were a quarter of a mile from the walls , and stood here and there in little groups , separated by large pools of stagnant water . " i might have dispensed with the care i had bestowed on my dress , " ( he had donned his naval uniform ) , " for the inhabitants , absorbed in their own affairs , let me pass without remark and never so much as looked at me . "
frederick james and bowditch left the english settlement on the 20nd august , 1800 , and arrived at <unk> , the ashantee capital , without meeting with any other obstacle than the insubordination of the bearers . the negotiations with a view to the conclusion of a treaty of commerce , and the opening of a road between <unk> and the coast , were brought to something of a successful issue by bowditch , but james proved himself altogether wanting in either the power of making or enforcing suggestions . the wisdom of bowditch ' s conduct was fully recognized , and james was recalled .
it would seem that geographical science had little to expect from a diplomatic mission to a country already visited by <unk> , <unk> , des <unk> , and many others , and on which <unk> and <unk> had written ; but bowditch turned to account his stay of five months at <unk> , which is but ten days ' march from the atlantic , to study the country , manners , customs , and institutions of one of the most interesting races of africa .
in spite of this great commercial movement , the prosperity of jenneh was threatened . sego <unk> , chief of the country , impelled by <unk> zeal , made fierce war upon the <unk> of sego , whom he wished to rally round the standard of the prophet . this struggle did a great deal of harm to the trade of jenneh , for it interrupted intercourse with <unk> , sansanding , <unk> , and <unk> , which were the chief <unk> for its produce .
the portrait of the timmannee monarch deserves a place in our volume for more than one reason . it is a case of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
like his predecessors in africa , laing had to go through many discussions about the right of passage through the country and bearers ' wages , but thanks to his firmness he managed to escape the <unk> of the negro kings . the chief <unk> on the route taken by the major were : <unk> , where a white man had never before been seen ; <unk> , <unk> , which he ascertained to be situated in n . lat . 8 degrees 30 minutes , and w . long . 10 degrees 10 minutes ; <unk> , beyond a very broad stream flowing north of the rokelle ; and <unk> , the chief frontier town of timmannee . in timmannee laing made acquaintance with a singular institution , a kind of <unk> , known as " <unk> , " the existence of which on the borders of the rio nuñez had been already ascertained by caillié .
the first town the brothers came to was <unk> , a large and spacious city , which for <unk> , noise , and confusion , could not be surpassed . next came <unk> , inhabited by <unk> people , and the island of <unk> , where the niger divides into three parts . just beyond , the travellers suddenly found themselves opposite a remarkable rock , two hundred and eighty feet high , called mount <unk> , which rises perpendicularly from the centre of the stream . this rock is greatly venerated by the natives , who believe it to be the favourite home of a beneficent genius .
thus ended the vicissitudes of the brothers lander ' s journey . they were in some danger in crossing the bar , but that was their last . they reached fernando <unk> , and then the <unk> river where they embarked on the <unk> for rio janeiro , at which port admiral <unk> , then commanding the station , got them a passage on board a <unk> .
on the 9 th june they disembarked at portsmouth . their first care , after sending an account of their journey to lord <unk> , then colonial secretary , was to inform that official of the conduct of captain lake , conduct which was of a nature to compromise the credit of the english government . orders were at once given by the minister for the payment of the sums agreed upon , which were perfectly just and reasonable .
truly he had not much reason to congratulate himself on having waited from october to april for such an answer as this . so little were the chief results hoped for by his government achieved , that no russian vessel could ever again enter a japanese port . a short-sighted , jealous policy , resulting in the putting back for half a century the progress of japan .
kruzenstern now entered the corea channel , and determined the longitude of <unk> , obtaining a difference of thirty-six minutes from the position assigned to that island by la pérouse . this difference was subsequently confirmed by <unk> , who can be fully relied upon .
after having surveyed patience gulf , which had only been partially examined by the <unk> <unk> , and at the bottom of which flows a stream now named the neva , kruzenstern broke off his examination of saghalien to determine the position of the kurile islands , never yet accurately laid down ; and on the 5 th june , 1800 he returned to petropaulovski , where he put on shore the ambassador and his suite .
from the first the sight of the extensive marshes led them to believe the island to be uninhabited , and they were soon convinced of the justice of this opinion . huts were built and land was cleared ; but the english <unk> assigned to the natives , whom they had carried off or who had elected to join them , the position of slaves . two years passed by without any serious dissensions arising , but at the end of that time the natives laid a plot against the whites , of which , however , the latter were informed by an <unk> woman , and the two leaders paid for their <unk> attempt with their lives .
since 1800 several eruptions of lava have caused terrible devastation in these islands . in may , 1800 , the <unk> volcano opened a new crater , and vomited forth flames .
both french and spanish colonists had at different times imported into these islands oxen , horses , and pigs , which had multiplied to a singular extent in the island of conti ; but the persistent hunting of them by the crews of the <unk> ships must tend to considerably reduce their numbers . the only quadruped indigenous to the falkland islands is the antarctic dog , the muzzle of which <unk> resembles that of the fox . it has therefore had the name <unk> , or <unk> , given to it by whalers . these animals are so fierce that they rushed into the water to attack byron ' s sailors . they , however , find rabbits enough , whose <unk> powers are limitless , to satisfy them ; but the seals , which the dogs attack without any fear , manage to escape from them .
the thetis only touched at macao to leave some missionaries , and to hoist the french flag , and bougainville set sail again on january 8 th .
another excursion was made in the blue mountains , where the famous " king ' s table-land " was visited , from which a magnificent view was obtained . the explorers gained with great difficulty the top of an eminence , and an abyss of 1600 feet at once opened beneath them ; a vast green carpet stretching away to a distance of some twenty miles , whilst on the right and left were the distorted sides of the mountain , which had been rudely rent asunder by some earthquake , the irregularities corresponding exactly with each other . close at hand <unk> a roaring , rushing torrent , flinging itself in a series of cascades into the valley beneath , the whole passing under the name of " <unk> ' s waterfall . " this trip was succeeded by a kangaroo hunt in the <unk> with mr . <unk> , one of the chief <unk> of the prosperity of new south wales . bougainville also turned his stay at sydney to account by laying the <unk> of a monument to the memory of la pérouse . this <unk> was erected in botany bay , upon the spot where the navigator had pitched his camp .
in the ensuing days it was ascertained that this was no solitary island , but one of a chain of islets forming so to speak the <unk> of a lofty continent . this continent , stretching away for 200 miles in an e . n . e . and w . s . w . direction , was called graham , whilst the name of biscoe was given to the islets in honour of their discoverer . there was no trace either of plants or animals in this country .
when the news of the grand discoveries made by the united states reached england , a spirit of <unk> was aroused , and the learned societies decided on sending an expedition to the regions in which weddell and biscoe had been the only explorers since the time of cook .
this is our task and that of our contemporaries . is it less grand than that of our predecessors , that it has not yet succeeded in inspiring any great writer of fiction ? to dwell upon it ourselves would be to exceed the limits we laid down for our work . we meant to write the history of the discovery of the world , and we have written it . our task therefore is complete .
the plaza-mayor .
" it is a shame ! " resumed the young mestizo . " there is don <unk> , who passes in his carriage drawn by two horses ! don <unk> d ' <unk> ! he has scarcely property enough to feed his coachman and horses , and he must come to parade himself proudly about the square . and , hold ! here is another ! the marquis don vegal ! "
" yes , we will have fine sport , dear andré , mounted on your millions , on a golden pedestal ! and you are about to double your fortune ! when are you to marry the beautiful young daughter of old samuel , a <unk> to the end of her nails , with nothing jewish about her but her name of sarah ? "
evening in the streets of lima .
the latter was still grumbling , muttering and <unk> , which prevented her seeing any thing ; the young girl turned toward the good father and made a graceful sign with her hand .
martin paz turned . a man of noble stature and of great pride of countenance was pointing to a <unk> .
" here are some jewels of great value , " resumed don vegal , without noticing the language of the jew ; " besides i can sell you at a low price a considerable <unk> near <unk> . "
" señor , i cannot give you a half real more ! "
" how can i promise you this , don vegal ? i speak only the truth , and i should <unk> myself were i to take an oath to that effect . "
the spaniard always remembered the daughter of samuel , whom he had so unexpectedly seen at prayer in the catholic temple . but he had not dared to confide this important secret to martin paz while <unk> him by degrees in christian <unk> ; he feared to <unk> sentiments which he wished to extinguish - for the poor indian , unknown and <unk> , must renounce all hope of happiness ! father joachim kept don vegal informed of the progress of affairs : the police had at last ceased to trouble themselves about martin paz ; and with time and the influence of his protector , the indian , become a man of merit and capable of great things , might one day take rank in the highest peruvian society .
samuel bent down to his ear .
but the indian had not heard this last sentence ; he had dived to avoid the approach of the boat , and his eyes could see a shapeless mass gliding rapidly toward him . he thought it was the canoe - he was mistaken .
" my son had then no pity on my tears , " said the sambo , " since he suffered me for so long a time to believe in his death ? "
now , while they fearlessly enjoyed these picturesque views , and were giving themselves up to an irresistible delight , a gloomy bloody funereal drama was preparing on the snowy summits of the cordilleras .
the clock on the tower of the cathedral suddenly struck five ! and a shrill funereal sound vibrated through the air ; the <unk> thundered over the crowd , frozen in its delirium .
" ah ! " replied the counsellor ; " really , i should not be astonished if it fell on some <unk> any day . "
niklausse ' s preparations for departure consumed at least a quarter of an hour ; for , after having lighted his lantern , he had to put on his big <unk> socks and his <unk> gloves ; then he put up the furred collar of his overcoat , turned the brim of his felt hat down over his eyes , grasped his heavy <unk> umbrella , and got ready to start .
" unless it is propped up , " added van tricasse . " but must it be propped up ? that is the question . "
and the audience ! the audience , panting , all in a heat , <unk> and howls . all the faces are as red as if a fire were burning within their bodies . they crowd each other , <unk> each other to get out - the men without hats , the women without mantles ! they elbow each other in the <unk> , crush between the doors , quarrel , fight ! there are no longer any officials , any burgomaster . all are equal amid this infernal frenzy !
" but what , friend niklausse , did we come to the top of this tower to do ? "
van tricasse retorted with a rude expression .
the burgomaster van tricasse , despite the warlike ardour with which he was filled , had not thought it best to throw himself upon the enemy without warning him . he had , therefore , through the medium of the rural policeman , <unk> , sent to demand reparation of the virgamenians for the offence committed , in 1100 , on the quiquendonian territory .
this gas , <unk> and <unk> , spread in generous quantity through the atmosphere , causes , when it is breathed , serious agitation to the human organism . one who lives in an air saturated with oxygen grows excited , frantic , burns !

" why say you so ? " asked gerande . " it seems very natural to me . nothing lasts for ever in this world . the infinite cannot be fashioned by the hands of men . "
gerande thought she would go mad with terror . what was her father doing ? she opened the door , and it escaped from her hands , and <unk> loudly with the force of the tempest . gerande then found herself in the dark <unk> , succeeded in gaining , on <unk> , the staircase which led to her father ' s shop , and pale and fainting , glided down .
" lord , it is true enough ! " replied scholastique , handing a watch to aubert .
" faith , he goes well , " said he , with a satisfied air , " for it is just four o ' clock . fear nothing , my child ; it is not a man , it is a clock ! "
" well said , master , " he replied . " <unk> had less right than you to compare himself with god ! your glory must not perish ! so your servant here desires to give you the method of controlling these rebellious watches . "
" wait till the first fine weather , my friends . the season is coming which <unk> existence in wearied bodies . we want the sun to warm us all ! "
scholastique alone refused to listen to reason on the subject ; but her efforts failed to prevent the unwelcome visitors from reaching her master , and from soon departing with some valuable object . then her chattering was heard in all the streets of the neighbourhood , where she had long been known . she eagerly denied the rumours of sorcery and magic on the part of master zacharius , which gained currency ; but as at bottom she was persuaded of their truth , she said her prayers over and over again to <unk> her pious <unk> .
with these words he sprang from his bed towards a book in which the names of his customers and the articles which had been sold to them were inscribed . he seized it and rapidly turned over its leaves , and his emaciated finger fixed itself on one of the pages .
" do not abandon your children ! " cried aubert .
an immense hall , better preserved than the rest , was soon reached . high sculptured panels , on which serpents , <unk> , and other strange figures seemed to <unk> themselves confusedly , covered its walls . several long and narrow windows , like <unk> , shivered beneath the bursts of the tempest .
then aubert and gerande returned to geneva , and during the long life which god accorded to them , they made it a duty to <unk> by prayer the soul of the castaway of science .
" monsieur , " said he , " your <unk> is french all over : it comes from my own country . i morally press the hand you refuse me . make all precautions , and act as seems best to you . i will wait till you have done - "
" the aeronauts perceived calais . their joy was delirious . a few moments more , and they had fallen in the forest of <unk> . i do not doubt , " added the unknown , " that , under similar circumstances , you would have followed doctor jeffries ' example ! "
chapter i .
" and yourself , captain , " said andré . " you will set us all a good example , for you have still as much vigour as experience . "
" who knows whither we shall be forced to go , marie ? look at this map . we are approaching places dangerous even for us sailors , hardened though we are to the difficulties of the sea . and thou , frail child ? "
in exchange for pieces of iron and brass , of which they are extremely <unk> , these poor creatures brought bear furs , the skins of <unk> , sea-dogs , sea-wolves , and all the animals generally known as seals . jean cornbutte obtained these at a low price , and they were certain to become most useful .
a mournful silence followed this remark .
" cornbutte , " said he to the captain , who had come up to him , " we are buried under this snow ! "
" she cannot , must not die thus ! " he cried .
[illustration : penellan advanced towards the norwegians . ]
louis cornbutte led penellan on deck , and asked him how much firing was left .
" the coal was exhausted long ago , " replied penellan , " and we are about to burn our last pieces of wood . "
penellan precipitated himself upon vasling , to whom , no doubt , was confided the task to fight him alone ; for his accomplices rushed to the beds where lay misonne , turquiette , and nouquet . the latter , ill and <unk> , was delivered over to herming ' s ferocity . the carpenter seized a hatchet , and , leaving his berth , hurried up to encounter aupic . turquiette and jocki , the norwegian , struggled fiercely . gervique and gradlin , suffering horribly , were not even conscious of what was passing around them .
piteous cries now assailed his ears ; it was marie ' s voice . herming was trying to drag her up . louis was seized with a desperate rage . he stiffened himself to bend vasling ' s loins ; but at this moment the combatants felt themselves seized in a powerful embrace . the bear , having descended from the mast , had fallen upon the two men . vasling was pressed against the animal ' s body . louis felt his claws entering his flesh . the bear , was strangling both of them .
the return of the birds indicated a diminution of the cold ; but it was not safe to rely upon this , for with a change of wind , or in the new or full moons , the temperature suddenly fell ; and the sailors were forced to resort to their most careful precautions to protect themselves against it . they had already burned all the barricading , the <unk> , and a large portion of the bridge . it was time , then , that their wintering was over . happily , the mean temperature of march was not over sixteen degrees below zero . marie occupied herself with preparing new clothing for the advanced season of the year .
about one o ' clock the steps and voices of the guides , and the noise of opening doors , indicated that that moment was approaching . soon ravanel came in and said , " come , messieurs , get up ; the weather is magnificent . by ten o ' clock we shall be at the summit . "
[illustration : crossing the plateau . ]
a run of five minutes is a small matter for people who are only tired ; but for us , who were absolutely exhausted , to run even for so short a time on soft snow , in which we sank up to the knees , seemed an impossibility . nevertheless , we made an urgent appeal to our energies , and after two or three <unk> , drawn forward by one , pushed by another , we finally reached a snow hillock , on which we fell breathless . we were out of danger .
these words seemed to interpret the general feeling .
" and she goes well , too , under sail , " continued the quartermaster ; " close to the wind , and she ' s easily steered . now that ship is going to the polar seas , or my name is not cornhill . and then , see there ! do you notice that large <unk> over the head of her rudder ? "
" and besides , " said one , " the lading of the brig goes to prove what mr . cornhill has said . i heard it from clifton , who has shipped on her . the forward carries provisions for five or six years , and coal in proportion . coal and provisions are all she carries , and a quantity of woollen and sealskin clothing . "
" whether you would or not , " answered mr . cornhill , " you could never have shipped in the forward . "
" there ' s nothing but boldness about the ship , " continued cornhill , well pleased with himself . " the forward , - forward to what ? without saying that nobody knows who her captain is . "
shandon and johnson <unk> strictly with the recommendation about the health of the crew ; they all looked hardy and possessed enough animal heat to run the engines of the forward ; their elastic limbs , their clear and ruddy skin , showed that they were fit to encounter intense cold . they were bold , determined men , energetic and stoutly built ; they were not all equally vigorous . shandon had even hesitated about accepting some of them ; for instance , the sailors gripper and garry , and the harpooner simpson , who seemed to him too thin ; but , on the other hand , they were well built , they were earnest about it , and they were shipped .
" but , " continued shandon , " i suppose you know whither we are bound . "
" here , captain ! " he said .

the wind , which was uncertain , although in general favorable , was blowing in genuine april squalls . the forward sailed rapidly , and its screw , as yet unused , did not delay its progress . towards three o ' clock they met the steamer which <unk> between liverpool and the isle of man , and which carries the three legs of sicily on its <unk> . her captain hailed them , and this was the last good-by to the crew of the forward .
the nights were short ; since the 30st of january the sun had reappeared in refraction , and was every day rising higher and higher above the horizon . but it was hid by the snow , which , if it did not produce utter darkness , rendered navigation difficult .
during sunday the sailors had little to do . after divine service , which was read by shandon , the crew betook themselves to chasing wild birds , of which they caught a great many . these birds , prepared according to dr . clawbonny ' s method , were an agreeable addition to the <unk> of the officers and crew .
the polar circle was crossed at last ; on the 0 th of april , at midday , the forward passed by holsteinborg ; picturesque mountains arose in the east . the sea appeared almost free of ice , or , more exactly , the ice could be avoided . the wind was from the southeast , and the brig , under foresail , <unk> , and topsails , sailed up baffin ' s bay .
" and why not ? " cried the doctor .
" <unk> ; but for some years it has been noticed that the bay seems to be resuming its old ways and threatens to become closed , possibly for a long time , to sailors . an additional reason , by the way , for pushing on as far as possible . and yet it must be said , we look like people who are pushing on in unknown ways , with the doors forever closing behind us . "
" if he <unk> , i ' ll <unk> him open , " answered pen , drawing his knife .
[illustration]
" it ' s an enormous bear , " said one .

" evidently , " said johnson , " it ' s the only way open to us . "
at thirty-five minutes after eight a dull explosion was heard , much less deafening than had been anticipated . the outline of the mountains was suddenly changed , as by an earthquake ; a dense white smoke rose high in the air , and long cracks appeared in the side of the iceberg , of which the upper part was hurled to a great distance , and fell in fragments about the forward .
" well , " answered hatteras . " brunton ! " he shouted to the engineer , " make ready ! forward a little ! "
" not at all ! do you fancy the crew are sorry for the obstacles we are meeting ? on the contrary , they hope i shall be compelled to abandon my plans . so they do not murmur , and when the forward is headed for the south , it will be the same thing . fools ! they imagine they are returning to england ! but when i ' m turned towards the north , you will see a difference ! i swear solemnly that no living being shall make me <unk> from my course ! give me a passage , an opening through which my brig can go , and i shall take it , if i have to leave half her sheathing behind ! "
" one would say it was the track of a ship . "
" a whale to leeward ! "
" but did not the commander of the fox take a great deal away in 1800 ? " said hatteras .
[illustration]
hatteras was baffled . the doctor gazed and shook his head . shandon said nothing , but an attentive observer would have noticed a wicked smile about his lips .
" and it was here , you say , that it took place ? "
soon there was enough steam on ; the anchors of the forward were raised ; and the brig started eastward , heading for point beecher , and cutting through the newly formed ice .
[illustration]
" no , it ' s too late , " answered shandon .
" just remember , " resumed gripper , " his first voyage to baffin ' s bay and what came of it ! "
the hunters , guided by his distant barking , hastened after him ; they had to run a mile , and they got there all out of breath , which happens very soon in such an atmosphere . duke stood pointing about fifty feet from an enormous mass which was rolling about on the top of a small iceberg .
" a collar ? " asked the doctor again , examining the fox .
the 8 th the thermometer fell to -30° ; there was only ten days ' coal on board , and every one awaited with horror the moment when it should come to an end .
and johnson shook his head sadly , and fell to thinking gloomily . bell did not interrupt him . he knew that the supply of fat , which it had been so hard to acquire , would only last a week , even with the strictest economy .
" sir , " he said .
but before they had begun to make preparations for the trip , hatteras wanted to fix the position of the forward with the utmost exactitude . the importance of this calculation it is easy to see . once away from the ship , it could not be found again without knowing its position precisely .
it was drawn by six dogs ; they were strong in spite of their <unk> , and did not appear to be injured by the severity of the winter ; the <unk> of deerskin were in good condition ; perfect reliance could be placed on the equipment , which the greenlanders at upernavik had sold in conscience . these six animals alone could draw a weight of two thousand pounds without <unk> fatigue .
" the sledge ! " shouted the captain .
[illustration]
" well , bell ! " said the doctor , resisting .
" alas , bell , " continued the doctor , " you mean simpson ! the poor fellow is suffering terribly . "
he did not finish his sentence ; a cry from bell interrupted him ; he had turned over a tolerably large piece of ice and showed a stiff , frozen human leg in the ice .
" my ship ! my ship ! " he cried .
" yes , captain altamont . "
" he came in order to be lost , " answered johnson ; " he brought his crew to death , like all those whose <unk> leads them here . but , doctor , did the expedition accomplish what it set out for ? "
" what can he do in such circumstances ? " retorted bell , shrugging his shoulders . " can he change these pieces of ice into pieces of meat ? is he a god , who can work by miracles ? "
" well , let us go back to the snow-house , while johnson stays here on watch . "
" you go and join johnson ; i shall wait a few moments to puzzle the enemy . "
" no , johnson . "
march 4 th was palm sunday , - that day when the streets of the towns and villages of europe are filled with flowers and leaves ; bells are ringing , and the air is filled with rich perfumes . but here , in this desolate country , what sadness and silence ! the wind was keen and bitter ; not a leaf of foliage was to be seen ! but still , this sunday was a day of rejoicing for our travellers , for at last they were about to find supplies which would save them from certain death . they hastened their steps ; the dogs drew the sledge briskly , duke barked joyously , and they all soon reached the american ship . the porpoise was wholly buried beneath the snow ; there was no sign of mast , yard , or rigging ; all had been lost at the time of the shipwreck ; the ship lay on a bed of rocks now completely hidden . the porpoise was <unk> to one side by the violence of the shock , her bottom was torn open , so that the ship seemed uninhabitable . this was soon seen by the captain , the doctor , and johnson , after they had entered the vessel ; they had to cut away fifteen feet of ice to get to the hatchway ; but to their great joy they saw that the animals , many traces of which were to be seen , had spared the supplies .
" if we have here , " said johnson , " plenty of food and fuel , this hull does not seem inhabitable . "
in the middle of the coast the doctor noticed a sort of plateau about two hundred feet in diameter ; on three sides it was open to the bay ; the fourth was enclosed by an elevation about a hundred and twenty feet high ; this could be ascended only by steps cut in the ice . this seemed a proper place for a solid building , and it could be easily fortified ; nature had adapted it for the purpose ; it was only necessary to make use of the place . the doctor , bell , and johnson reached this place by means of steps cut in the ice . as soon as the doctor saw the excellence of the place , he determined to dig away the ten feet of hardened snow which covered it ; the buildings had to be built on a solid foundation .
" a capital plan ! " answered altamont .
the doctor went out ; his companions followed him to the top of the cone ; the column was promptly built and was soon surmounted by one of the porpoise ' s lanterns . then the doctor arranged the conducting wires which were connected with the pile ; this was placed in the parlor of the <unk> , and was preserved from the frost by the heat of the stoves . from there the wires ran to the lantern . all this was quickly done , and they waited till sunset to judge of the effect . at night the two charcoal points , kept at a proper distance apart in the lantern , were brought together , and flashes of brilliant light , which the wind could neither make <unk> nor extinguish , issued from the lighthouse . it was a noteworthy sight , these sparkling rays , <unk> the brilliancy of the plains , and <unk> sharply the outlines of the surrounding objects . johnson could not help clapping his hands .
there is a gloomy monotony about life at the pole . man is wholly the sport of the changes of the weather , which <unk> between intense cold and severe storms with savage <unk> . the greater part of the time it is impossible to set foot out of doors ; one is imprisoned in the hut of ice . long months pass in this way , so that men lead the life of moles .
" probably , " answered the doctor , " for here is an answer addressed to the committee : -
the doctor , altamont , and bell determined to explore the country . altamont , they felt sure from his habits , was a bold and skilful hunter , and , with all his <unk> , a capital shot . so he went with the hunters , as did duke , who was equally skilful and less <unk> to boasting .
" so , at any risk we must get out ! " said altamont .
" good ! will you tell us what means you intend to employ to rid us of these unpleasant visitors ? "
" but what is your plan , after all ? " asked altamont .
" before he refuses , " answered the doctor , " he must be asked . i will undertake to do it . "
whether or not his predecessors had been wrong on this great question of an open polar sea , he hoped soon to know . all chance of success in his undertaking depended on this . one evening , after a warm day in which the ice had given unmistakable signs of breaking up , he turned the conversation to the question of an open sea . he took up the familiar arguments , and found the doctor , as ever , a warm advocate of his doctrine . besides , his conclusions were evidently accurate .
" well , in a <unk> it ' s important to have the ship reach her destination . if the northwest passage ever becomes practicable , it must be for ships and not for sledges . the ship must accomplish the voyage , or if not the ship , the launch . "
" wait a moment , " cried the doctor , - " wait a moment , you hasty fellow . they don ' t think of running away ! see , they ' ll come to us ! "
he hastened with clawbonny to the scene of combat . his hesitation had not lasted half a second . but if the doctor saw what was taking place in the american ' s heart , hatteras understood it , who would rather have died than have implored his rival ' s interference . still , he had hardly time to perceive it , for altamont appeared before him . hatteras , lying on the ground , was trying to ward off the horns and hoofs of the two animals . but he could not long continue so unequal a struggle . he was about to be torn in pieces , when two shots were heard . hatteras heard the bullets whistling by his head .
when they turned towards the doctor , they saw his eyes full of tears .
thereupon he started to cut up the ox , which he called the " ox of reconciliation , " but he did it as skilfully as if he were a surgeon conducting a delicate <unk> . his two companions gazed at him in amusement . in a few minutes he had cut from the body a hundred pounds of flesh ; he gave each one a third of it , and they again took up their march to fort providence . at ten o ' clock in the evening , after walking in the oblique rays of the sun , they reached doctor ' s house , where johnson and bell had a good supper awaiting them .
bell had finished the launch ; it was perfectly satisfactory for the purpose it was intended for ; partly decked , and partly open , it could sail in heavy weather under mainsail and jib , while it was so light as not to be too heavy a load on the sledge for the dogs .
this <unk> probably ran back to a remote period , for the mushrooms were not decomposed by either evaporation or the melting of the snow , nor was their color altered .
" why not ? " asked the doctor ; " that ' s a good idea ; it wouldn ' t light up the road much , but we could see the guide , and follow him more easily . "
the sky at a considerable height had an ashy hue ; the darkness , which was so marked during the tempest , and of which the doctor could give no satisfactory explanation , evidently came from the ashes , which completely hid the sun . he remembered a similar fact that took place in 1800 , at the <unk> , which at noon was plunged into total darkness by the mass of cinders thrown from the crater of isle st . vincent .
" so it seems from here , " answered johnson ; " but we shall find some place for our boat ; that is all we need . "
[illustration : " they noticed a little fiord . " ]
" is it swifter than the other ? "
" heavens ! " said bell ; " you ' d need a <unk> to move your legs . "
" hatteras , " said the doctor , " this is far enough ! we can ' t go any farther ! "
then the four men and the captain , - a poor body without a mind , - and his faithful duke , sad and melancholy , got into the boat for the return voyage . it was ten o ' clock in the morning . a new sail was set up with the canvas of the tent . the launch , sailing before the wind , left queen ' s island , and that evening the doctor , standing on his bench , waved a last farewell to mount hatteras , which was lighting up the horizon .
" abandon the launch and take the sledge ? well , " answered the doctor ; " but instead of crossing lincoln , i propose going through jones ' s sound on the ice , and reaching north devon . "

this journey , the only one of its kind , went over all the discoveries that had been made in the regions about the pole ; it brought together the expeditions of parry , ross , franklin , macclure ; it completed the chart between the one hundredth and one hundred and fifteenth meridians ; and , finally , it ended with the point of the globe hitherto inaccessible , with the pole itself .
at this noise torres woke , and with the quickness of those who are always on the watch , with whom there is no transition from the sleeping to the waking state , was immediately on his legs .
" ah ! he is about to <unk> the frontier ! " said he , with a deep voice . " let him <unk> it ! and he will be still more at my mercy ! pleasant journey to you , joam garral ! "
" ah ! joam ! my joam ! " cried yaquita , in her joy . " thank you for me ! thank you for them ! "
chapter v . the amazon
" in short , the <unk> and most admirable river system which we have in the world . "
" yes , " said yaquita , " and in that way we shall reach belem without danger or fatigue . "
and so the four , followed by the black , struck under the splendid trees , whose thick foliage prevented the sun ' s rays from every reaching the soil .
" you are at home , minha , or at least you say so , " said benito , " and that is the way you talk of your riches ! "
" let benito laugh on , minha , " said manoel . " he hides it very well , but he is a poet himself when his time comes , and he admires as much as we do all these beauties of nature . only when his gun is on his arm , good-by to poetry ! "
it was lina who spoke .
but it was with the young mulatto that he claimed to have contracted the heaviest obligation .
the weather was magnificent . a pleasant " <unk> " tempered the ardor of the sun - one of those winds which in june or july come from off the cordilleras , many hundred leagues away , after having swept across the huge plain of the sacramento . had the raft been provided with masts and sails she would have felt the effects of the breeze , and her speed would have been greater ; but owing to the sinuosities of the river and its abrupt changes , which they were bound to follow , they had had to renounce such assistance .
the birds were giving forth their last evening notes - " <unk> , " who hang their nests on the <unk> reeds ; " <unk> , " a kind of partridge , whose song is composed of four notes , in perfect accord ; " <unk> , " with their plaintive melody ; kingfishers , whose call <unk> like a signal to the last cry of their congeners ; " <unk> , " with their sonorous trumpets ; and red <unk> , who fold their wings in the foliage of the " <unk> , " when night comes on to dim their glowing colors .
" mr . manoel , " answered fragoso , with comic gravity , " it appears that there is - or rather formerly was - a trunk of ' <unk> , ' which every year at the same time descended the rio negro , stopping several days at manaos , and going on into para , halting at every port , where the natives ornamented it with little flags . arrived at belem , it came to a halt , turned back on its road , remounted the amazon to the rio negro , and returned to the forest from which it had mysteriously started . one day somebody tried to drag it ashore , but the river rose in anger , and the attempt had to be given up . and on another occasion the captain of a ship harpooned it and tried to tow it along . this time again the river , in anger , broke off the ropes , and the trunk mysteriously escaped . "
" by no means , mr . garral , since you have allowed me to accompany you to belem , where i hope at the least to be able to resume my old trade . "
among the natives it was quite the reverse . husbands and wives , the jolly barber knew them well , and he knew they would give him a better reception .
on the 0 th of june the pilot signaled on the right the little village of <unk> , where they halted for two or three hours .
" perhaps , " said fragoso , " they might ask the opinions of the caymans , dolphins , and <unk> , for they certainly prefer the black waters to the others to enjoy themselves in . "
this <unk> operation is a grand affair for the <unk> indians of the amazon and its tributaries . they watch for the arrival of the chelonians , and proceed to the extraction of the eggs to the sound of the drum ; and the harvest is divided into three parts - one to the watchers , another to the indians , a third to the state , represented by the captains of the shore , who , in their capacity of police , have to superintend the collection of the <unk> . to certain beaches which the decrease of the waters has left uncovered , and which have the privilege of attracting the greater number of turtles , there has been given the name of " royal beaches . " when the harvest is gathered it is a holiday for the indians , who give themselves up to games , dancing , and drinking ; and it is also a holiday for the alligators of the river , who hold high <unk> on the remains of the amphibians .
the hunters were therefore in luck . the pirogue was filled with these interesting amphibians , and they arrived just in time for breakfast . the booty was divided between the passengers and crew of the jangada , and if any lasted till the evening it did not last any longer .
" just look at those fine ladies in their fine clothes ! "
a pirogue , going down the river , came alongside the jangada , after being hailed by joam garral .
the arm followed by the pilot , between <unk> island and the shore , was very narrow , although it appeared sufficiently large . this was owing to a great portion of the island being slightly above the mean level , but still covered by the high flood waters . on each side were massed forests of giant trees , whose summits towered some fifty feet above the ground , and joining one bank to the other formed an immense cradle .
" and the long lianas , which so <unk> stretch from one tree to another ! " added the young mulatto .
" and what would you do with this diamond worth something considerable , fragoso ? " <unk> lina .
they went toward the house , entered it , and the door was shut on them .
in extraordinary contrast , joam garral was master of himself , and almost smiling .
yes , manoel knew all this , and , further , he knew that joam garral - or rather joam dacosta - was innocent , and his misfortunes made him even <unk> and more devoted to him . what he did not know was that the material proof of the innocence of the fazender existed , and that this proof was in the hands of torres . joam garral wished to reserve for the judge himself the use of this proof , which , if the adventurer had spoken truly , would <unk> his innocence .
" dead ! " exclaimed joam garral , crushed for a moment by the news - " dead ! dead ! "
" evidently . "
and this is easily intelligible in the face of the happiness of the family , which increased on every side . this happiness was his work , and it might be destroyed forever by his return .
the letter was sent and delivered as addressed , and the magistrate only waited for joam dacosta to commence on the serious undertaking which he hoped to bring to a successful issue .
chapter v . material proofs
" and the culprit is living ? "
" come on ! " replied benito .
" to the prison ! " said benito .
manoel tried to make benito lie down , so as to take a few hours ' rest .
these <unk> are now much improved , and are less dangerous than formerly . the man beneath the liquid mass can easily bear the additional pressure , and if anything was to be feared below the waters it was rather some cayman who might there be met with . but , as had been observed by araujo , not one of these amphibians had been seen , and they are well known to prefer the black waters of the tributaries of the amazon . besides , in case of danger , the diver has always his <unk> fastened to the raft , and at the least warning can be quickly hauled to the surface .
benito thought that all was over ; his eyes grew dim , his limbs began to <unk> .
we can easily imagine the violent agitation which had seized upon the spectators of this scene . benito could scarcely utter a word , he felt his heart ready to burst . " open it , sir ! open the case ! " he at last exclaimed , in a broken voice .
joam dacosta took the document and carefully examined it . shaking his head , he handed it back to his son . " perhaps , " he said , " there is therein written the proof i shall never be able to produce . but if that proof escapes me , if the whole tenor of my life does not plead for me , i have nothing more to expect from the justice of men , and my fate is in the hands of god ! "
" ah ! " he exclaimed , " why did not the scoundrel who wrote this separate the words in this paragraph ? we might - we will try - but no ! however , if there is anything here about the murder and the robbery , two or three words there must be in it - ' arrayal , ' ' diamond , ' ' tijuco , ' ' dacosta , ' and others ; and in putting down their <unk> <unk> the number could be arrived at . but there is nothing - not a single break ! - not one word by itself ! one word of two hundred and seventy-six letters ! i hope the wretch may be blessed two hundred and seventy-six times for <unk> his system in this way ! he ought to be hanged two hundred and seventy-six times ! "
" i will find it , " answered fragoso .
" what is it , gentlemen ? what do you want ? " he asked .
" nothing ! nothing ! "
manoel and benito spent an hour about the spot , taking care not to attract attention , but examining the locality with great exactness , particularly as regarded the position of the window , the arrangement of the iron bars , and the place from which it would be best to throw the line .
and from that moment judge jarriquez , who possessed this <unk> proof , arranged with the chief of the police , and declined to allow joam dacosta , while waiting new instructions from rio janeiro , to stay in any prison but his own house .
majestically the panorama of both banks moved along without a pause , as though some ingenious mechanism necessitated its unrolling in the opposite direction to that of the stream .
the hearts of the passengers of the giant raft beat high . at length they were coming to the end of the voyage which they had thought they would never reach . while the arrest of joam detained them at manaos , halfway on their journey , could they ever have hoped to see the capital of the province of para ?
it was a magnificent day , and from about ten o ' clock in the morning the raft began to receive its crowd of guests . on the bank could be seen almost the entire population of belem in holiday costume . on the river , vessels of all sorts crammed with visitors gathered round the enormous mass of timber , and the waters of the amazon literally disappeared even up to the left bank beneath the vast flotilla .

" name it , my boy , " said the engineer , addressing the lad .
" still another minute ! " said pencroft .
at this moment the reporter appeared round a rock , and herbert , thinking that he had not seen the jaguar , was about to rush towards him , when gideon spilett signed to him to remain where he was . this was not his first tiger , and advancing to within ten feet of the animal he remained motionless , his gun to his shoulder , without moving a muscle . the jaguar collected itself for a spring , but at that moment a shot struck it in the eyes , and it fell dead .
after half an hour ' s rest , the settlers resumed their journey , and not a spot among the rocks was left <unk> . pencroft and neb even rushed into the surf whenever any object attracted their attention . but they found nothing , some curious formations of the rocks having deceived them . they ascertained , however , that eatable shell-fish abounded there , but these could not be of any great advantage to them until some easy means of communication had been established between the two banks of the mercy , and until the means of transport had been perfected .
herbert then thought of fastening a cord to an arrow , and shooting the arrow so that it should pass between the first rounds of the ladder which hung from the threshold . by means of the cord they would then be able to draw down the ladder to the ground , and so re-establish the communication between the beach and granite house . there was evidently nothing else to be done , and , with a little skill , this method might succeed . very fortunately bows and arrows had been left at the chimneys , where they also found a quantity of light hibiscus cord . pencroft fastened this to a <unk> arrow . then herbert fixing it to his bow , took a careful aim for the lower part of the ladder .
" who was it ? didn ' t you see ? "
" i knew that it was only a joke , " cried pencroft , " but one of the <unk> shall pay the penalty for the rest . "
" there ! " said pencroft . " and what shall we make of him , now we ' ve got him ? "
the manoeuvre consisted simply in surrounding the musmons and goats , and gradually narrowing the circle around them . cyrus harding , pencroft , neb , and jup , posted themselves in different parts of the wood , whilst the two cavaliers and top galloped in a radius of half a mile round the corral .
[illustration : pencroft to the <unk>
" we will make one . "
and yet so deeply is the love of his country <unk> in the heart of man , that if a ship had unexpectedly come in sight of the island , the colonists would have made signals , would have attracted her attention , and would have departed !
all , towards the evening after dinner , were seated under the <unk> on the edge of prospect heights , and they were watching the darkness creeping up from the horizon . some cups of the infusion of elder berries , which took the place of coffee , had been served by neb . they were speaking of the island and of its isolated situation in the pacific , which led gideon spilett to say , -
however , before returning to the dockyard , cyrus harding conceived the idea of <unk> certain machines , which greatly excited the curiosity of his companions . he took a dozen of the whale ' s bones , cut them into six equal parts , and sharpened their ends .
pencroft worked with unparalleled ardour , and only a sturdy frame could have borne such fatigue ; but his companions were preparing in secret a reward for his labours , and on the 30st of may he was to meet with one of the greatest joy ' s of his life .
" that is reassuring for us , but a bad look-out for our great <unk> ! " observed pencroft .
" it is evident , " said gideon spilett , " that this well is in direct communication with the sea , and that some marine animal comes from time to time to breathe at the bottom . "
they were a species of <unk> , some similar to those of the cape , with eatable <unk> leaves , others bearing seeds containing a sort of flour .
[illustration : the <unk>
the head of the bonadventure , which was a little to the south of the island , was set directly towards it , and as the sun mounted in the east , his rays fell upon one or two headlands .
" it is a long time since this room has been inhabited , " observed herbert .
" meanwhile the duncan had been sent to melbourne for repairs . it was necessary , then , to get lord glenarvan to order her to leave melbourne and go to the east coast of australia , where it would be easy to seize her . after having led the expedition near enough to the coast , in the midst of vast forests with no resources , ayrton obtained a letter , which he was charged to carry to the mate of the duncan - a letter which ordered the yacht to repair immediately to the east coast , to twofold bay , that is to say , a few days ' journey from the place where the expedition had stopped . it was there that ayrton had agreed to meet his accomplices , and two days after gaining possession of the letter , he arrived at melbourne .
" as you like , ayrton , " answered cyrus harding . ayrton was going to withdraw , when the engineer addressed one more question to him : -
" of course it must be so , " replied pencroft , " without that the fact would be unaccountable . "
during the night , cyrus harding and gideon spilett had no opportunity for talking together , and yet the words pronounced in the reporter ' s ear by the engineer were well worth being discussed , together with the mysterious influence which appeared to reign over lincoln island . gideon spilett did not cease from pondering over this new and inexplicable incident , - the appearance of a fire on the coast of the island . the fire had actually been seen ! his companions , herbert and pencroft , had seen it with him ! the fire had served to <unk> the position of the island during that dark night , and they had not doubted that it was lighted by the engineer ' s hand ; and here was cyrus harding expressly declaring that he had never done anything of the sort ! spilett resolved to recur to this incident as soon as the bonadventure returned , and to urge cyrus harding to acquaint their companions with these strange facts . perhaps it would be decided to make in common a complete investigation of every part of lincoln island .
" what is especially curious , " observed harding , " is that the gulf has been formed by two rivers of lava , thrown out by the volcano , and accumulated by successive eruptions . the result is that the gulf is completely sheltered on all sides , and i believe that even in the <unk> weather , the sea here must be as calm as a lake . "
<unk> , herbert , and neb were stupefied . no illusion could be possible , and a fire had actually met their eyes during the night of the 9 th of october .
[illustration : returning from a sporting <unk>
but , as we have seen , all the mechanical difficulties had not been overcome . many evenings had been devoted to discussing , not the form of its screw nor its dimensions , but whether it ought to be put behind , as the <unk> brothers had done , or before as captains krebs and renard had done . it is unnecessary to add that the partisans of the two systems had almost come to blows . the group of " <unk> " were equaled in number by the group of " <unk> . " uncle prudent , who ought to have given the casting vote - uncle prudent , brought up doubtless in the school of professor <unk> - could not bring himself to decide .
chapter iv
robur did not even frown . with folded arms he waited bravely till silence was obtained .
" <unk> , " said the voice of a <unk> .
" doesn ' t it cut ? " asked uncle prudent .
" nothing . "
" no . "
if the <unk> - striking like the wings of a bird - raised itself by beating the air , the <unk> raised itself by striking the air obliquely , with the fins of the screw as it mounted on an inclined plane . these fins , or arms , are in reality wings , but wings disposed as a helix instead of as a paddle wheel . the helix advances in the direction of its axis . is the axis vertical ? then it moves vertically . is the axis horizontal ? then it moves horizontally .
the whole of robur ' s flying apparatus depended on these two movements , as will be seen from the following detailed description , which can be divided under three heads - the platform , the engines of suspension and propulsion , and the machinery .
" yes , " said phil evans , " there is the town in its <unk> , the hill with its citadel , the gibraltar of north america . there are the <unk> . there is the custom house with its dome surmounted by the british flag ! "
" if you please . "

anyhow , the journals of the union would be certain to notice the fact . it would be the explanation of the astonishing phenomenon which the whole world had been wondering over for some time .
" i don ' t know , " said turner .
" and then ? " asked uncle prudent .
soon the aeronef was gliding about twenty-five feet above him . his tail was beating the waters with incredible violence , and as he turned over on his back an enormous wave was produced .
the " albatross " did not linger over the lake through which the river flows , but continued her flight down the valley of the hydaspes .
since the departure from timbuktu uncle prudent and phil evans noticed that the course had been due south . if that direction was persisted in they would cross the equator in six more degrees . the " albatross " would then abandon the continents and fly not over the <unk> sea , or the caspian sea , or the north sea , or the mediterranean , but over the atlantic ocean .
we know - and he knew - that the kingdom of dahomey is one of the most powerful on the west coast of africa . strong enough to hold its own with its neighbor ashantee , its area is somewhat small , being contained within three hundred and sixty leagues from north to south , and one hundred and eighty from east to west . but its population numbers some seven or eight hundred thousand , including the neighboring independent territories of <unk> and <unk> .
this time he was not alone . he could not have performed the task . near him were grouped a hundred executioners , all accustomed to cut off heads at one blow .
of the hundred and forty-five million square miles of which the area of the world ' s waters consists , the atlantic claims about a quarter ; and it seemed as though the engineer was in no hurry to cross it . there was now no going at full speed , none of the hundred and twenty miles an hour at which the " albatross " had flown over europe . here , where the southwest winds prevail , the wind was ahead of them , and though it was not very strong , it would not do to defy it and the " albatross " was sent along at a moderate speed , which , however , easily outstripped that of the fastest <unk> .
on the 3 th of july she crossed the line , and the fact was duly announced to the crew . it was then that uncle prudent and phil evans ascertained that they were bound for the southern hemisphere . the crossing of the line took place without any of the <unk> ceremonies that still linger on certain ships . tapage was the only one to mark the event , and he did so by pouring a pint of water down frycollin ' s neck .
the work was only interrupted for a moment while the elevation of the sun above the horizon allowed robur to take an <unk> angle , so that at the time of its culmination he could calculate his position .
the result of the observation , taken with the greatest exactitude , was as follows :
there was a noise on the " albatross . " evidently , the alarm had been given . the escape was discovered .
it was then that robur , with extraordinary coolness , climbed up to the broken deck-house , and seizing the lever reversed the rotation , so that the propeller became a <unk> . the fall continued , but it was checked , and the wreck did not fall with the <unk> swiftness of bodies influenced solely by gravitation ; and if it was death to the survivors of the " albatross " from their being hurled into the sea , it was not death by <unk> amid air which the rapidity of descent rendered <unk> .
eighty seconds after the explosion , all that remained of the " albatross " plunged into the waves !
meanwhile they had to wait for an opportunity of returning to america . the chatham islands are not much visited by navigators , and all august passed without sign of a ship . the fugitives began to ask themselves if they had not exchanged one prison for another .
of course the balloonists were longing to ask uncle prudent and the secretary about all these things , but they looked so close and so serious that they thought it best to respect their attitude . when they thought fit to speak they would do so , and it would be an honor to hear . after all , there might be in all this some secret which would not yet be divulged .
the " albatross " left x island in the first week of april . during this aerial passage robur did not want to be seen from the earth , and he came along almost always above the clouds . when he arrived over north america he descended in a desolate spot in the far west . there the engineer , keeping a profound incognito , learnt with considerable pleasure that the weldon institute was about to begin its experiments , and that the " go-ahead , " with uncle prudent and phil evans , was going to start from philadelphia on the 9 th of april .
the president , the secretary , and the aeronaut had only to jump down .
as for the future of aerial locomotion , it belongs to the aeronef and not the aerostat .

" inexplicable , certainly , mr . strock . for on my part , i do not believe it possible that the great eyrie can be a volcano ; the alleghanies are nowhere of volcanic <unk> . i , myself , in our immediate district , have never found any geological traces of scoria , or lava , or any eruptive rock whatever . i do not think , therefore , that morganton can possibly be threatened from such a source . "
the great eyrie
in the afternoon the whole chain of the blueridge stretched before us at a distance of only six miles . the mountain crests were sharply outlined against the clear sky . well wooded at the base , they grew more bare and showed only stunted <unk> toward the summit . there the <unk> trees , <unk> twisted , gave to the rocky heights a <unk> and <unk> appearance . here and there the ridge rose in sharp peaks . on our right the black dome , nearly seven thousand feet high , reared its gigantic head , sparkling at times above the clouds .
at that period the most improved automobiles , whether driven by steam , <unk> , or electricity , could not accomplish much more than sixty miles an hour , a speed that the railroads , with their most rapid expresses , scarce exceed on the best lines of america and europe . now , this new automobile which was astonishing the world , traveled at more than double this speed .
but even satan himself had no right to run at such speed over the roads of the united states without a special permit , without a number on his car , and without a regular license . and it was certain that not a single municipality had given him permission to go two hundred miles an hour . public security demanded that some means be found to <unk> the secret of this terrible chauffeur .
the start was to be made at eight o ' clock in the morning ; and to avoid crowding and the accidents which must result from it , the automobiles were to follow each other at two minute intervals , along the roads whose borders were black with spectators .
" none , " i answered , knowing well to what she referred .
" then , sir , if you please , of what use are the police ? "
" cheer up , and let us see if it is not better news than that . "
" do not try again , for the second attempt will not result as did the first , but will have grave consequences for you .

before the day was over , various rewards of large amounts were promised to anyone who revealed the hiding place of this dangerous inventor , to anyone who could identify him , and to anyone who should rid the country of him .
" and the place is called ? "
" i think not , mr . strock ; but i only saw the same two . several times they came to the edge of the little wood where i was hidden , and gathered sticks for a fire which they made upon the beach . the region is so uninhabited and the creek so hidden from the lake that they ran little danger of discovery . they seemed to know this . "
we stole softly back to where the ravines rose toward the woods above . several <unk> in the rocks were at hand . wells and i crouched down in one , my two assistants in another . if the men on the " terror " landed , they could not see us ; but we could see them , and would be able to act as opportunity offered .
as was already known , the power by which the machine was driven , was neither steam nor <unk> , nor any of those similar liquids so well known by their odor , which are usually employed for automobiles and <unk> . no doubt the power here used was electricity , generated on board , at some high power . naturally i asked myself whence comes this electricity , from piles , or from accumulators ? but how were these piles or accumulators charged ? unless , indeed , the electricity was drawn directly from the surrounding air or from the water , by processes hitherto unknown . and i asked myself with intense eagerness if in the present situation , i might be able to discover these secrets .
need i add that the captain of the " terror " was the other of the two men , who had watched my house in long street . moreover , if i recognized him , he also must recognize me as <unk> strock , to whom had been assigned the task of penetrating the great eyrie .
thus if an opportunity for flight presented itself , i should not find myself in an unknown district . but would this chance offer ? and at heart , did i desire it , or would i seize upon it ? what secrets still remained in this affair in which good fortune or was it evil fortune - had so closely entangled me !
i had seen with what rapidity , and also with what ease the transformation of the " terror " had been made . no less easy and rapid , perhaps , would be her change to an automobile .
in fact , except for that of my cabin , the hatchways were closed ; and it would be vain for me to attempt to open them . at any rate , it might be more interesting to find out what kind of propeller drove the " terror " in these many transformations .
" citizens of the united states , the conquest of the air is made ; but it shall not be given into your hands until the proper time . i leave , and i carry my secret with me . it will not be lost to humanity , but shall be entrusted to them when they have learned not to abuse it . farewell , citizens of the united states ! "
chapter 10
in search of the castaways .
" indeed , your lordship , " replied captain mangles , " i think it is a shark of large proportions . "

" for any information concerning the brig britannia of glasgow , captain grant , address lord glenarvan , malcolm castle , luss , county of dumbarton , scotland . "
[illustration : " please , madam , speak ! i am strong against grief , and can hear all . " ]
" my father , my poor father ! " cried mary grant , throwing herself at the feet of lord glenarvan .
to complete the roll of the passengers , it will be sufficient to describe major macnabb . the major was a man of fifty , of calm , regular features , who did as he was bid ; of an excellent and superior character , modest , taciturn , peaceable , and mild ; always <unk> with anything or any one , disputing nothing , and neither contradicting himself nor exaggerating . he would mount with measured step the staircase to his <unk> , even were a cannon-ball behind him ; and probably to his dying day would never find an opportunity to fly into a passion .
" when a mere child , i played on my father ' s ships . he ought to have made a sailor of me . if it were necessary , perhaps i should not now be embarrassed in taking a reef or twisting a <unk> . "
the steward of the yacht was an excellent manager , a scotchman , who deserved to have been a frenchman from his <unk> , and , moreover , fulfilled his duties with zeal and intelligence . he was at once ready for his master ' s commands .
lady helena and miss grant could not find a word to answer . they were completely bewildered by the presence of this intruder .
" i thank you , my lord , and must be resigned . but we can say this is an extraordinary adventure , which would not have happened but for me . and my cabin which is engaged on board the scotia ? "
thus far the duncan had acquitted herself admirably : in every way her powers for steaming or sailing had been sufficiently tested , and her captain and passengers were alike satisfied with her performance and with one another .
as for the learned geographer , he was probably the happiest man in the southern hemisphere . he passed his time in studying the maps with which he covered the <unk> ; and then followed daily discussions with mr . olbinett , so that he could scarcely set the table .
" my advice is to find the thirty-seventh parallel , just where it meets the american coast , and follow it , without <unk> half a degree , to the point where it strikes the atlantic . perhaps we shall find on its course the survivors of the britannia . "
[sidenote : the procession formed . ]
any one but macnabb would have passed by , around , or even over this hut a hundred times without suspecting its existence . a projection on the surface of the snow scarcely distinguished it from the surrounding rocks . it was necessary to <unk> it ; after half an hour of persistent labor , wilson and mulready had cleared away the entrance to the " <unk> , " and the little party stepped in .
" what ! " cried the major , " are you not content with our supper , paganel ? "
" whence comes the noise , then ? " asked tom austin . " hear how it approaches ! "
at one moment he thought he heard distant rumblings , dull and threatening like the <unk> of thunder . these sounds could be caused only by a tempest , raging on the sides of the mountain . he wished to convince himself , and left the hut .
a cry of horror was uttered . in the claws of the condor an inanimate body was seen suspended and dangling . it was robert grant . the bird had raised him by his garments , and was now hovering in mid-air at least one hundred and fifty feet above the encampment . he had perceived the travelers , and was violently striving to escape with his heavy prey .
[sidenote : " the lost is found . " ]
and he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued from the mouth of a geographer .
on issuing from the gorges of the andes , they encountered a great number of <unk> , called " <unk> , " real waves incessantly agitated by the wind , when the roots of the herbage did not confine them to the earth . this sand is of an extreme fineness ; and , at the least breath , they saw it float away in light clouds , or form regular <unk> which rose to a considerable height . this spectacle caused pleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes . pleasure , for nothing was more curious than these columns , wandering over the plain , struggling , mingling , sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion ; and annoyance , since an impalpable dust <unk> from these innumerable <unk> and penetrated the eyelids , however tightly they were closed .
" good , i know , " said paganel , and addressing his companions : " a change in the weather is about to take place . we shall have a ' <unk> . ' "
thalcave did not appear to hear him . paganel already saw an ironical smile forming upon the lips of the major , and , wishing to save his reputation , had begun with renewed energy his geographical demonstrations , when the patagonian stopped him with a gesture .
they set out at daybreak . the horses advanced at a brisk pace among the tufts of " <unk> , " a kind of grass that serves the indians as a shelter during the storms . at certain distances , but less and less frequent , pools of shallow water contributed to the growth of willows and a certain plant which is found in the neighborhood of fresh water . here the horses drank their fill , to <unk> themselves for the journey . thalcave , who rode in advance , beat the bushes , and thus frightened away the " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , while the agile thaouka bounded over all obstacles , and aided his master in clearing a passage for the horses that followed .
" i see him still , " replied the boy , as if speaking to himself . " good and brave papa ! he rocked me to sleep on his knees , when i was little , and kept humming an old scottish song which is sung around the lakes of our country . i sometimes recall the air , but indistinctly . how we loved him , my lord ! well , i think one must be very young to love his father well . "
[sidenote : gained at last . ]
night came , - the night of the new moon , only the uncertain light of the stars illumined the plain . on the horizon the <unk> light faded away in a dark mist . the waters of the guamini flowed without a murmur , while birds , quadrupeds , and reptiles reposed after the fatigues of the day . the silence of the desert reigned on the vast expanse of the pampas .
" i have been curious for a long time , " said he to the major , " to see a <unk> fly . "
when he had joined his companions , paganel found glenarvan in excited conversation with the indian , whom he did not appear to understand . thalcave had frequently stopped to examine the horizon , and each time his countenance expressed a lively astonishment . glenarvan , not seeing his ordinary interpreter present , had attempted , but in vain , to question the patagonian . so , as soon as he perceived the geographer at a distance , he cried , -

although the eye did not yet reveal the peril that thaouka divined , the ear could already detect it . a low murmur , like the sound of a rising tide , was heard as from the limit of the horizon . the wind blew in damp gusts laden with spray ; the birds , as if <unk> from some unknown phenomenon , shot swiftly through the air ; and the horses , <unk> to their knees , felt the first impulse of the current . soon a mingled roar , like bellowing , neighing , and bleating , resounded half a mile to the south , and immense herds appeared , tumbling , rising , and rushing , a confused mass of terrified beasts , and fled by with frightful rapidity . it was scarcely possible to distinguish them in the midst of the clouds of spray dashed up by their flight .
" paganel ! paganel ! " cried glenarvan .
" no , but - - "
[sidenote : a strange bark . ]
at last a white smoke issued from the side of the yacht .
they pushed off , and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the ebbing tide . for a long time the motionless outline of the indian was seen through the foam of the waves . then his tall form grew indistinct , and soon became invisible . an hour afterwards they reached the duncan . robert was the first to spring upon the deck , where he threw himself upon his sister ' s neck , while the crew of the yacht filled the air with their joyous shouts .
he stretched out his arms towards mary ' s brother , and pressed his lips to the boy ' s cheeks , which were still wet with tears .
" the <unk> ! " said paganel .
[sidenote : warm springs and warm talk . ]
" major , " said paganel , " will you wager your rifle against my telescope that i cannot name at least fifty australian explorers ? "
" you act wisely . what do you apprehend ? "
" what is the matter ? " cried captain mangles , rushing to the stern .
" i will inform them only at the last moment , when all hope is gone of keeping at sea . you will tell me . "
the captain ' s first care was to secure anchorage . he moored the vessel in five fathoms of water . the bottom was good , a hard gravel , affording an excellent hold . there was no danger of drifting , or of stranding at low tide . the duncan , after so many hours of peril , was now in a sort of creek sheltered by a high promontory from the fury of the wind .
" ' he is in australia , ' you added . "
" you do not know , then , where he is ? "
" i think , like you , " continued ayrton , " that captain grant and his two sailors were saved from the shipwreck ; but , since they have not reached the english possessions , since they have not reappeared , i doubt not that their fate was the same as my own , and that they are prisoners of the natives . "
" i will think of it , my lord , " said the quartermaster , modestly .
only one change had been made in the line of march since leaving camden bridge . the criminal disaster on the railway , when made known to ayrton , had induced him to take precautions hitherto needless . the horsemen were not to lose sight of the cart . during the hours of encampment one of them was always on guard . morning and evening the <unk> of the fire-arms was renewed . it was certain that a band of malefactors were scouring the country ; and , although nothing gave cause for immediate suspicion , still it was necessary to be ready for any emergency .
all day long our travelers pursued their way under these interminable arches . they met neither quadruped nor human being . a few cockatoos inhabited the tops of the trees ; but at that height they could scarcely be distinguished , and their chattering was an almost inaudible murmur . sometimes a flock of parrots would shoot across a distant vista , <unk> it with a rapid flash of variegated light . but generally a deep silence reigned in this vast temple of verdure , and the measured tread of the horses , a few words exchanged now and then in <unk> conversation , the creaking of the <unk> , and from time to time a cry from ayrton as he urged on his sluggish team , were the only sounds that disturbed this vast solitude .
but at that moment a voice , <unk> pitched , was heard . the <unk> was accompanied by a <unk> . the geographer listened incredulously , but in a few moments was forced to recognize the sublime air that struck upon his ear . it was " il <unk> <unk> <unk> " from don juan .
in the mean time , in accordance with the hosts ' orders , breakfast had been prepared by the steward of the station , and in less than a quarter of an hour the travelers were seated at a <unk> table . the quality of the viands and the wines was <unk> ; but what was especially gratifying , in the midst of these <unk> of wealth , was the evident pleasure experienced by the young settlers in <unk> to strangers , beneath their own roof , this magnificent hospitality .
he replied in an <unk> way to the questions that were addressed him ; but his answers sufficed to determine ayrton upon his course . glenarvan , however , <unk> the <unk> for the little trouble they had given him , and was about to leave the inn , when a placard , affixed to the wall , attracted his attention . it was a notice of the colonial police , detailing the escape of the convicts from perth , and setting a price upon the head of ben joyce - a hundred pounds sterling to any one who should deliver him up .
" seventy-five miles , " replied paganel .
[illustration : " if it please your lordship , i will go . " ]
[sidenote : <unk> . ]
" but it is a perilous venture , john , " said glenarvan . " aside from the dangers of this journey of two hundred miles across an unknown country , all the roads may be guarded by ben joyce ' s accomplices . "
" what is the matter ? " asked the major .
[sidenote : a gloomy prospect . ]
at that moment the tempest redoubled its violence . the lofty branches of the trees shook <unk> in the darkness . you could hear the fall of the dry twigs on the drenched earth . more than one giant tree , whose sap was gone , but which had stood till then , fell during this terrible hurricane . the wind roared amid the cracking of the trees and mingled its mournful sounds with the rushing of the river . the heavy clouds that chased across the sky poured forth masses of mist , while a dismal darkness increased still more the horrors of the night .
" no , " interposed the major ; " it is a <unk> to entice us away from the cart . "
it was a plaintive and despairing voice . captain mangles and the major rushed towards it . in a few moments they perceived , on the edge of the coppice , a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning piteously . it was mulready , wounded and half dead . when his companions raised him , they felt their hands <unk> in blood . the rain now increased , and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees . in the midst of these terrific gusts , glenarvan , the major , and the captain bore the body of mulready .
captain mangles felt at heart all glenarvan ' s anguish , and , as he wished to overcome the difficulty at all hazards , he constructed a canoe in the australian fashion , with large pieces of the bark of the gum-trees . these <unk> , which were very light , were held together by wooden <unk> , and formed a very frail craft .
mulready was now quite well . he scarcely felt his wound , which had so nearly proved fatal . a few hours at sea would complete his recovery .
glenarvan shook his head .
" poor women ! " murmured glenarvan . " john , my heart is broken , and sometimes i feel as if despair had invaded it . it seems to me as if new calamities awaited us , as if heaven had decreed against us ! i am afraid ! "
captain mangles could not help being anxious . any other vessel would have <unk> these surges ; but with this heavy hulk they might well fear foundering , for the deck was flooded with every plunge , and the masses of water , not finding sufficient outlet by the <unk> , might <unk> the ship . it would have been wise , as a preparation for any emergency , to cut away the <unk> to facilitate the egress of the water ; but will halley refused to take this precaution .
" not more than two cable-lengths distant . "
[illustration : the sailor who was steering , and had been forcibly pushed aside , did not at all understand this sudden attack . ]
" what ! nobody ? " said glenarvan .
" and these are my reasons , " said he . " first , we are very much fatigued , and all our strength is necessary to free the vessel . then , when this is accomplished , how can we sail among the dangerous breakers , and in such profound darkness ? moreover , another reason induces me to wait . the wind promises to aid us , and i desire to profit by it , and am in hopes that it will drift the old hull out when the tide raises her . to-morrow , if i am not mistaken , the breeze will blow from the northwest . we will set the <unk> , and they will help to raise the brig . "
the coast was only nine miles distant , - not a difficult voyage for a <unk> boat ; but with the raft it was necessary to advance slowly . if the wind held out , they might perhaps reach land with this tide ; but if there should be a calm , the ebb would carry them back , or they would be compelled to anchor and wait for the next tide .
" that is true , " answered paganel . " let us try to determine its position , that we may not run upon it when the tide covers it . "
wilson discovered , fortunately , a cavern , hollowed out by the sea in the basaltic rocks of the shore , and here the travelers took refuge with their arms and provisions . there was an abundance of dry sea-weed , lately cast up by the waves . this formed a soft couch , of which they availed themselves . several pieces of wood were piled up at the entrance and then kindled ; and while the fire served to dry their garments conversation <unk> the hours , as they lay or stood at ease .
the group of trees was reached , and each <unk> to the geographer ' s rigorous regulations . the cold supper was noiselessly eaten , and soon a profound sleep overcame the weary travelers .
" is it really so ? " cried the major .
at this word the crowd fell back before glenarvan and his companions , thus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power . a few moments after they were led back to the temple that served as their prison ; but robert grant and paganel were no longer with them .
" you saw the prisoner , our tohonga ? "
after the death of kara-tété , paganel had taken advantage , like robert , of the confusion of the natives , and escaped from the pah . but less fortunate than young grant , he had fallen upon an encampment of maoris , who were commanded by a chief of fine form and intelligent appearance , who was evidently superior to all the warriors of his tribe . this chief spoke english accurately , and bade him welcome by rubbing his nose against that of the geographer . paganel wondered whether he should consider himself a prisoner ; but seeing that he could not take a step without being graciously accompanied by the chief , he soon knew how matters stood on this point .
" because he <unk> set his love upon me , therefore will i deliver him : " <unk> <unk> . i .
" my friends , " said he , " my project has this advantage , that if it does not produce the result that i expect , or even fails , our situation will not be impaired . but it ought to and will succeed . "
it will be needless to <unk> upon the incidents of the journey , which were neither numerous nor important . their way led through forests and over plains . the captain took his bearings by the sun and stars . the sky , which was quite clear , was sparing of heat and rain . still , an increasing weariness delayed the travelers , already so cruelly tried , and they had to make great efforts to reach their destination .
" to sea ! to sea ! " cried he ; " better perish in the waves than be captured ! "
" hang , then ! " cried glenarvan , overcome by a sudden feeling of indignation .
this plan being adopted , the engineer was ordered to force on steam . half an hour afterwards the yacht was headed towards talcahuana , and at six o ' clock in the evening the mountains of new zealand had disappeared beneath the mists of the horizon .
" i ! " cried paganel .
at eight o ' clock maria theresa , although only five miles to windward , appeared like a lengthened shadow , scarcely visible . an hour later , quite a bright light , like a fire , blazed in the darkness . it was motionless and stationary .
" if it had been his father , " answered the lad , with irrepressible energy , " he would not say so . it was my father , my lord ! my father , my father - - ! "
it was not long before glenarvan related ayrton ' s story to the captain , who confirmed the quartermaster ' s declaration in regard to his having been abandoned on the australian coast .
at the word " tabor , " paganel had suddenly risen , and then , controlling himself no longer , he cried :
" 4 . at what precise moment will the moon present herself in the most favorable position to be reached by the projectile ?
5 th . it will meet the moon four days after its discharge , precisely at midnight on the 4 th of december , at the moment of its transit across the zenith .
" what is to be done , then ? " said elphinstone , with a puzzled air .
" in fact , " continued barbicane , " cast iron costs ten times less than bronze ; it is easy to cast , it runs readily from the <unk> of sand , it is easy of <unk> , it is at once economical of money and of time . in addition , it is excellent as a material , and i well remember that during the war , at the siege of atlanta , some iron guns fired one thousand rounds at intervals of twenty minutes without injury . "
" two million five hundred and ten thousand seven hundred and one dollars . "
" moreover , pyroxyle is unaltered by moisture - a valuable property to us , inasmuch as it would take several days to charge the cannon . it <unk> at 100 degrees in place of 200 , and its combustion is so rapid that one may set light to it on the top of the ordinary powder , without the latter having time to ignite . "
three days after the <unk> of president barbicane <unk> , 000 were paid into the different towns of the union . with such a balance the gun club might begin operations at once . but some days later <unk> were received to the effect that foreign subscriptions were being eagerly taken up . certain countries distinguished themselves by their liberality ; others untied their <unk> with less facility - a matter of temperament . figures are , however , more eloquent than words , and here is the official statement of the sums which were paid in to the credit of the gun club at the close of the subscription .
on the morrow some of the small horses of the spanish breed , full of vigor and of fire , stood <unk> under his windows ; but instead of four steeds , here were fifty , together with their riders . barbicane descended with his three <unk> travelers ; and much astonished were they all to find themselves in the midst of such a <unk> . he remarked that every horseman carried a carbine slung across his shoulders and pistols in his <unk> .

j . t . maston was no longer master of himself . whether he shouted or gesticulated , ate or drank most , would be a difficult matter to determine . at all events , he would not have given his place up for an empire , " not even if the cannon - loaded , primed , and fired at that very moment - were to blow him in pieces into the planetary world . "
attack and <unk>
" no ! i desire that all that passes between us shall be secret . their is a wood situated three miles from tampa , the wood of skersnaw . do you know it ? "
" about an hour . "
a few moments later the two friends had disappeared in the copse . it was a dense thicket , in which rose huge <unk> , sycamores , <unk> , olives , <unk> , oaks , and <unk> . these different trees had <unk> their branches into an inextricable <unk> , through which the eye could not penetrate . michel ardan and maston walked side by side in silence through the tall grass , cutting themselves a path through the strong creepers , casting curious glances on the bushes , and momentarily expecting to hear the sound of rifles . as for the traces which barbicane ought to have left of his passage through the wood , there was not a vestige of them visible : so they followed the barely perceptible paths along which indians had tracked some enemy , and which the dense foliage <unk> overshadowed .
" it must be all over , " said maston , discouraged . " a man like barbicane would not <unk> with his enemy , or <unk> him , would not even maneuver ! he is too open , too brave . he has gone straight ahead , right into the danger , and doubtless far enough from the bushman for the wind to prevent his hearing the report of the rifles . "
" but surely , " replied michel ardan , " since we entered the wood we should have heard ! "
nicholl <unk> watched its flight , when he heard these words pronounced by a voice full of emotion :
" the plan for <unk> the effect of the shock at the departure of the projectile ! "
" good ! " said ardan . " i cannot pretend to make you agree ; but i suggest this : go with me , and so see whether we are stopped on our journey . "
among the deputations of all kinds which assailed him , that of " the lunatics " were careful not to forget what they owed to the future conqueror of the moon . one day , certain of these poor people , so numerous in america , came to call upon him , and requested permission to return with him to their native country .

" nothing would be simpler , " replied ardan ; " the columbiad will be always there . well ! whenever the moon is in a favorable condition as to the zenith , if not to the perigee , that is to say about once a year , could you not send us a shell packed with provisions , which we might expect on some appointed day ? "


" twenty seconds more ! " barbicane quickly put out the gas and lay down by his companions , and the profound silence was only broken by the <unk> of the chronometer marking the seconds .
" no , " replied ardan , much surprised ; " certainly i did not hear the detonation . "
" how ? " said ardan .
chapter iii
barbicane observed with some interest that his guns and other arms had not been damaged . these were important , because , heavily loaded , they were to help lessen the fall of the projectile , when drawn by the lunar attraction ( after having passed the point of neutral attraction ) on to the moon ' s surface ; a fall which ought to be six times less rapid than it would have been on the earth ' s surface , thanks to the difference of bulk . the inspection ended with general satisfaction , when each returned to watch space through the side windows and the lower glass <unk> .

" seriously ? "
" well ? " asked nicholl .
" yes , eclipses of the sun , " replied barbicane , " when the centers of the three orbs are on a line , the earth being in the middle . but they are only partial , during which the earth , cast like a screen upon the solar disc , allows the greater portion to be seen . "
" hurrah ! " exclaimed michel ; " these meteors are handy <unk> , and cost nothing . and how we shall be able to laugh at the post-office administration ! but now i think of it - - "
" the deuce ! " answered nicholl . " do you consider the weight of a thread 0000 miles long nothing ? "

" that is a strong remark . "
they were not more fortunate with regard to another peculiarity of the disc , for they could not decide upon the cause of it .
" get along with you , " said barbicane , smiling .
one inexplicable fact preoccupied barbicane . why , having passed within such a short distance of the moon - about twenty-five miles only - why the projectile had not fallen ? if its speed had been enormous , he could have understood that the fall would not have taken place ; but , with a relatively moderate speed , that resistance to the moon ' s attraction could not be explained . was the projectile under some foreign influence ? did some kind of body retain it in the ether ? it was quite evident that it could never reach any point of the moon . whither was it going ? was it going farther from , or nearing , the disc ? was it being borne in that profound darkness through the infinity of space ? how could they learn , how calculate , in the midst of this night ? all these questions made barbicane uneasy , but he could not solve them .

a sailor can change the head of his ship as he pleases ; an aeronaut can give a vertical motion to his balloon . they , on the contrary , had no power over their vehicle . every maneuver was forbidden . hence the inclination to let things alone , or as the sailors say , " let her run . "
" what ! the sun ? " answered nicholl and michel ardan .
" moon of the moon ! " cried michel ardan .
" has the moon been inhabited ? " he asked .
chapter xx

" what is it ? " exclaimed everyone around him .
the hudson ' s bay company was probably in greater danger of ruin than any other ; but in 1800 , after much discussion , a treaty was made , in accordance with which its old rival the north-west company became amalgamated with it , the two receiving the common title of " the hudson ' s bay fur company . "
very happily for thomas black , however , lieutenant jaspar hobson had another idea .
" but , captain , " replied the astronomer , " i heard that the company was sending an expedition along the northern coast of america , and i did not wish to miss the departure of lieutenant hobson . "
3 . corporal joliffe .
10 . kellet , do .
10 . mac-nab , do .
in all , nineteen persons to be transported several hundreds of miles through a desert and <unk> country .
lieutenant hobson likewise took several casks of rum and whisky ; but he was firmly resolved to economise these spirits , so injurious to the health in cold latitudes , as much as possible . the company had placed at his disposal a little portable medicine-chest , containing formidable quantities of lime-juice , lemons , and other simple remedies necessary to check , or if possible to prevent , the <unk> affections which take such a terrible form in these regions .
my dear , " replied madge , " i have not the gift of remembering like you . you retain your impressions , i forget mine . "
" so , poor madge , " she said , " you are very cold ! "
" yes , madam ; and i admired them as they deserved . but i returned home with fresh love and enthusiasm for my native land . cold is my element , and no merit is due to me for braving it . it has no power over me ; and , like the esquimaux . i can live for months together in a snow hut . "
" along the shores of the lake ? "
" let us be off , sir ! let us be off ! " cried old norman , looking anxiously at the fog above his head . " let us start without losing an instant . there are terrible signs in the air ! "
mrs paulina barnett looked inquiringly at hobson .
" and what do you call it ? "
the country behind them seemed to possess two entirely distinct characters ; to the east and south the cape was bounded by a vast plain , many hundreds of square miles in extent , while behind the cliff , from " walruses ' bay " to the mountains mentioned above , the country had undergone terrible convulsions , showing clearly that it owed its origin to volcanic eruptions . the lieutenant was much struck with this marked contrast , and sergeant long asked him whether he thought the mountains on the western horizon were volcanoes .
" well , there are not many of them ! " said mrs barnett .
in the pursuit of lynxes and <unk> or gluttons , fire-arms had to be used . the <unk> has all the suppleness and agility of the feline tribe to which it belongs , and is formidable even to the rein-deer ; marbre and sabine were , however , well up to their work , and succeeded in killing more than sixty of them . a few <unk> or gluttons were also despatched , their fur is reddish-brown , and that of the <unk> , <unk> with black spots ; both are of considerable value .
on the 5 th december all excursions had again to be given up . the wind veered suddenly to the north , and the cold became exceedingly severe . it was impossible to remain out of doors without being frost-bitten . the fahrenheit thermometer fell to 10^0 below zero , and the gale roared like a volley of musketry . hobson took care to provide the animals with food enough to last several weeks .
the day passed without any incident . the bears went and came , prowling round the house , but attempting no direct attack . watch was kept all night , and at four o ' clock in the morning they seemed to have left the <unk> any rate , they were nowhere to be seen .
" yes , yes , madam , you are right , " replied hobson ; " but we can ' t help our presentiments . i am no <unk> . twenty times in my soldier ' s life i have been in critical circumstances , and have never lost presence of mind for one instant ; and now for the first time in my life i am uneasy about the future . if i had to face a positive danger , i should have no fear ; but a vague uncertain peril of which i have only a presentiment "
" where , then , do you suppose we are ? " inquired mrs barnett .
chatting thus and laying plans for the future , the three explorers continued to follow the coast . they noticed no change ; the abrupt cliffs covered with earth and sand showed no signs of a recent alteration in the extent of the island . it was , however , to be feared that the vast sheet of ice would be worn away at the base by the action of the warm currents , and on this point hobson was naturally anxious .
the meal was quickly over , and hobson returned to the southwest angle of the island , whilst mrs barnett rested at the foot of a low fir tree , and sergeant long made ready the night quarters .
this was the great danger .
" keep hold ! "
sergeant long , however , thought but little of his bath , and was ready to begin mining in some other place . this mrs barnett would not allow . a night in the open air would do her no harm ; the shelter of the coppice near would be protection enough for them all ; and sergeant long was obliged to submit .
the palisade was now completely finished , and mac-nab , remembering the sufferings of the last winter , built a new wood shed close up against the house itself , with a door of communication inside , so that there would be no need to go outside at all . by this contrivance the fuel would always be ready to hand . on the left side of the house , opposite the shed , mac-nab constructed a large sleeping-room for the soldiers , so that the <unk> could be removed from the common room . this room was also to be used for meals , and work . the three married couples had private rooms walled off , so that the large house was relieved of them as well as of all the other soldiers . a magazine for furs only was also erected behind the house near the powder-magazine , leaving the loft free for stores ; and the rafters and ribs of the latter were bound with iron <unk> , that they might be able to resist all attacks . mac-nab also intended to build a little wooden chapel , which had been included in hobson ' s original plan of the factory ; but its erection was put off until the next summer .
but what was this distance compared to the vast extent of the ocean ? had not boats been known to be drifted several thousands of miles by currents ? was not this the case with the english ship resolute , the american brig advance , and with the fox , all of which were carried along upon ice-fields until the winter arrested their advance ?
" i know , sergeant , that you are always ready to do your duty , but you will not go alone . two of us ought to go , that we may be able to let our comrades know if any land is in sight ; and besides i must see for myself . . . we will go together . "
" till to-morrow , " she said to the lieutenant .
at the first step , both were flung violently to the ground , but they managed to scramble up , and clinging to each other with their backs bent like two old <unk> peasants , they struck into a kind of <unk> trot .
the two talked on in broken sentences , making each other hear above the roaring of the storm , and struggling to pierce the gloom which closed them in on every side ; but they could see nothing , not a ray of light broke the thick darkness .
a great hope kept her from despair , for she had at last recognised cape esquimaux , at the foot of which she and her people had encamped the year before . she knew now that she was but eight miles from the factory , and that she had only to follow the path she had so often traversed when she went to visit her friends at fort hope .
at half-past eleven a . m . , hobson gave the signal of departure . the sky was grey but clear , and lighted up from the horizon to the zenith by a magnificent aurora borealis . the dogs were harnessed to the sledges , and three couple of reindeer to the waggon sledges . silently they <unk> their way towards cape michael , where they would quit the island , properly so called , for the ice-field .
and without another word hobson stripped himself , plunged into the half-frozen water , and being a powerful swimmer a few strokes soon brought him to the other side of the crevasse , when he disappeared amongst the icebergs .
what bears and esquimaux could do might certainly also be done by skilful hunters , and kalumah hastened back to the fort to tell the lieutenant of what she had seen , feeling sure that where these holes were seals were not far off .
this was certainly good advice , and all returned to the large room , the windows were closed , but not the shutters .
the last week of february was very wet , rain and snow falling alternately . a strong wind blew from the north-west , and the temperature was low enough for large quantities of snow to fall ; the gale , however , increased in violence , and on the side of cape bathurst and the chain of icebergs the noise of the tempest was deafening . the huge ice-masses were flung against each other , and fell with a roar like that of thunder . the ice on the north was compressed and piled up on the shores of the island . there really seemed to be a danger that the cape <unk> was but a kind of iceberg capped with earth and <unk> be flung down .
every day kalumah went to examine the state of the ice-field .
the thaw continued to proceed rapidly from the 2nd to the 5 th april . the weather was warm but cloudy , and rain fell frequently in large drops . the wind blew from the south west , and was laden with the heated dust of the continent . unfortunately the sky was so hazy , that it was quite impossible to take observations , neither sun , moon , nor stars could be seen through the heavy mists , and this was the more provoking , as it was of the greatest importance to note the slightest movements of the island .
the observations of the 8 th may showed that the island had become stationary near the middle of the passage , at least forty miles from cape prince of wales , so that land was now at a comparatively short distance from it , and the safety of all seemed to be secured .
" oh , yes , " replied mrs joliffe , " there was plenty to eat in the pantry and kitchen . "
" nothing whatever , " replied the carpenter , " but let us work on , the roof has bent of course , but the floor of the loft cannot have given way . another ten feet and we shall come to that floor , or else " -
the lieutenant and the sergeant were together in greater anxiety than ever , and taking them aside , the carpenter told them of his dreadful disappointment .
yes , the ocean now encircled the wandering island , the sea was open at last , and a true sea-horizon shut in the view from east to west .
chapter xxii . the four following days . the night was calm , and in the morning the lieutenant resolved to order the embarkation of everything and everybody that very day . he , therefore , went down to the lake to look at the raft .

for the next few minutes both were silent , and then johnson asked what had become of the sledge .
" so much the better , " said clawbonny . " believe me , johnson , that man can save us yet . "
" very well , " said johnson , " we must make the journey in three weeks , since it is our last chance . even if we can only crawl on our knees before we get to our destination , we must be there in twenty-five days . "
for a minute or so , nothing more was said , and the <unk> waited with palpitating hearts .

the boatswain hurried to the only remaining place he could think of , the hummock where he had stood to watch the bear . but the missing treasure was nowhere to be found , and the old sailor returned in despair .
" hatteras never says a word to this american , and i must say the man has not shown himself very grateful . i am here , fortunately . "
" there is no doubt , " replied altamont , " of its utility ; but how would you contrive to make it ? "
" oh , i ' m prepared for everything after the mercury bullet , and the ice lens , and fort providence . i believe mr . clawbonny can do anything , " exclaimed johnson .
" we ' ll set you to work on it , " said bell , " and i ' ll eat as much as you like to please you . "

" the newspaper appeared daily from the 1st of november , 1800 , to the 0 th of march , 1800 . it reported the different excursions , and hunting parties , and accidents , and adventures , and published amusing stories . no doubt the articles were not up to the ' spectator ' or the ' daily telegraph , ' but the readers were neither critical nor <unk> , and found great pleasure in their perusal . "
" well , these are plain enough , i think ! "
his companions stood stupefied for a moment , but joy soon loosened their tongues , and each rushed eagerly forward to welcome his old comrade with a loving embrace . hatteras was for once fairly overcome with emotion , and positively hugged him like a child .
" well , they look to me to be bent on <unk> their own work , and getting right down to us as fast as possible ; but wait a bit , my gentlemen , we ' ll demolish you first . however , we have not a minute to lose . "
[illustration : ]
" well , there is no way then but for one of us to devote his life to the others , and go and light the powder himself . "

" wait , hatteras , i have one thing more to ask . do you look on me as a <unk> englishman like yourself , anxious for his country ' s glory ? "
his two companions looked on smiling . in a few minutes the adroit <unk> had cut off more than a hundred pounds of flesh . this he divided into three parts . each man took one , and they retraced their steps to fort providence .

load for four dogs , and all the more as they would have to drag it every day , instead of only four days successively , like the dogs employed by the esquimaux , who always keep a relay for their sledges . however , the distance to the pole was not 100 miles at the outside , and they did not intend to go more than twelve miles a day , as they could do it comfortably in a month . even if land failed them , they could always fall back on the sloop , and finish the journey without fatigue to men or dogs .
on all sides nothing could be heard but the noise of cracking ice and falling avalanches .
" you are right . the sea must be there , " was the reply .

after a little , hatteras was able to stand up supported by the doctor , and tried to get back to the sloop .
the 90° of lat . was then only about three quarters of a mile off , or just about the summit of the volcano .
" what ! take sixty-four and a half days , to fall ? " exclaimed johnson .
mount hatteras .
the doctor went towards him and spoke , but it was long before he could rouse him from his absorbing <unk> . at last the captain seemed to understand , and clawbonny said , while he examined him with a keen scrutinizing glance -
" and as friends , " added clawbonny .
" perhaps i am , " said hatteras , gravely .
they soon arrived , at a narrow part at the bottom of a ravine , and what a spectacle met their gaze ! dead bodies , already stiff , lay half-buried in a <unk> of snow . a leg visible here , an arm there , and yonder <unk> hands and rigid faces , stamped with the expression of rage and despair .
